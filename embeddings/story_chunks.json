Alice’ s EvidenceCHAPTER I.\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank,\nand of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her\nsister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is\nthe use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot\nday made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a\ndaisy-chain ",
    " “without pictures or conversations?”\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot\nday made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a\ndaisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the\ndaisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her .\nThere was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so\nvery much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh\ndear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to\nher that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed\nquite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its\nwaistcoat-pocket , and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her\nfeet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit\nwith either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with\ncuriosity , she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just",
    " her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit\nwith either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with\ncuriosity , she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to\nsee it pop down a lar ge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once conside ring how\nin the world she was to get out again.\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep\nwell.Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly , for she had plenty\nof time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going\nto happe n next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was\ncoming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides\nof the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-\nshelves; here and there she saw ma",
    "out what she was\ncoming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides\nof the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-\nshelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She\ntook down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled\n“ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty:\nshe did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so\nmanaged to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think\nnothing of tumbling down stairs ! How brave they’ll all think me at home!\nWhy , I wouldn’ t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the\nhouse!” (Which was very likely true.)\nDown, down, down. Would the fall never  come to an end? “I wonder\nhow many miles  I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting\nsomewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four\nthousan",
    "d the fall never  come to an end? “I wonder\nhow many miles  I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting\nsomewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four\nthousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several\nthings of this sort in her lessons  in the schoolroom, and though this was not\na very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one\nto listen  to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about\nthe right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitu de I’ve got\nto?” (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either , but thought\nthey were nice grand words to say .)\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through  the\nearth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with\ntheir heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad\nthere was no one listening, this time, as it didn’ t sound at all the right word)\n“—but I shall ha",
    "among the people that walk with\ntheir heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad\nthere was no one listening, this time, as it didn’ t sound at all the right word)\n“—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know .\nPlease, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey\nas she spoke—f ancy curtseying  as you’re fallin g through the air! Do you\nthink you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think\nme for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up\nsomewhere.”\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-\ntime. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no\nmice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a\nmouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice bega",
    "ar! I wish you were down here with me! There are no\nmice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a\nmouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to\nget rathe r sleepy , and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way,\n“Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?”\nfor, you see, as she couldn’ t answer either question, it didn’ t much matter\nwhich way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to\ndream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her\nvery earnestly , “Now , Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?”\nwhen suddenly , thump! thump!  down she came upon a heap of sticks and\ndry leaves, and the fall was over .\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long\npassage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.

    "ped up on to her feet in a moment:\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long\npassage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There\nwas not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in\ntime to hear it say, as it turned a corner , “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\nit’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the\nRabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall,\nwhich was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every\ndoor, she walke d sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\nget out again.\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’ s first\nthought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!\nei",
    "little three-legged table, all made of solid\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’ s first\nthought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!\neither the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it\nwould not open any of them. However , on the second time round, she came\nupon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little\ndoor about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock,\nand to her great delight it fitted!\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage\ninto the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that\ndark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and thosecool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway;\n“and even if my head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be\nof very little use without my",
    " bright flowers and thosecool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway;\n“and even if my head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be\nof very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like\na telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so\nmany out-of-the -way things had happened lately , that Alice had begun to\nthink that very few things indeed were really impossible.\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back\nto the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a\nbook of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a\nlittle bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,) and\nround the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK\nME,” beautifully printed on it in lar ge letters.\nIt was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not\ngoing to do that in a hurry. “No, I’ll look ",
    "er label, with the words “DRINK\nME,” beautifully printed on it in lar ge letters.\nIt was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not\ngoing to do that in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether\nit’s mark ed ‘poison ’ or not”; for she had read several nice little histories\nabout children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other\nunpleasant things, all because they would  not remember the simple rules\ntheir friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if\nyou hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a\nknife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much\nfrom a bottle marked “poison,”  it is almost certain to disagree with you,\nsooner or later .\nHowever , this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste\nit, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-\ntart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey , toffee, and hot butt",

First, however , she waited for\na few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little\nnervous about this; “for it might end, you know ,” said Alice to herself, “in\nmy going out altogether , like a candle. I wonder what I should be like\nthen?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the\ncandle is blown out, ",
    "w ,” said Alice to herself, “in\nmy going out altogether , like a candle. I wonder what I should be like\nthen?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the\ncandle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a\nthing.\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided  on going\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door,\nshe found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back\nto the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it\nquite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the\nlegs of the table , but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out\nwith trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\n“Come, there’ s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herse lf, rather\nsharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself\nvery good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes ",
    "in crying like that!” said Alice to herse lf, rather\nsharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself\nvery good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she\nscolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she\nremembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a\ngame of croquet  she was playin g against herself, for this curiou s child was\nvery fond of pretending to be two people. “But it’s no use now,” thought\npoor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why , there’ s hardly enough of me\nleft to make one respectable person!”\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she\nopened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME”\nwere beautifully  marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it\nmakes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller ,\nI can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I do",
    "s. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it\nmakes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller ,\nI can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t\ncare which happens!”\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which\nway?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\nsize: to be sure,  this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had\ngot so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-w ay things tohappen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common\nway.\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished of f the cake.\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *CHAPTER II.\nThe Pool of Tears\n“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to ",

Good-bye , feet!” (for\nwhen she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight,\nthey were gettin g so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put\non your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m sure I shan’t be able! I\nshall be a great  deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must\nmanage the best way you can;— but I must be kind to them,” thought Alice,\n“or perhaps they won’ t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I’ll give\nthem a new pair of boots every Christmas.”\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They\nmust go by the carrier ,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\npresents to one’ s own feet!

It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\nyou,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop thismoment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding  gallons of\ntears, until there was a large pool all round ",
    "girl like\nyou,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop thismoment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding  gallons of\ntears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and\nreaching half down the hall.\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she\nhastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit\nreturning, splend idly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand\nand a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry ,\nmuttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won’ t\nshe be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt so desperate that she was\nready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began,\nin a low, timid voice, “If you please, sir—” The Rabbit started violently ,\ndropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the\ndarkness as hard as he could go.\nAlice took up the fan and glove s, an",

How queer\neverything is to-day! And yeste rday things went on just as usual. I wonder\nif I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got\nup this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But\nif I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s\nthe great puzzle !” And she began thinking over all the childre n she knew\nthat were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed\nfor any of them.\n“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long ringlets,\nand mine doesn’ t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t be Mabel, for I\nknow all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a ver",

Besides,\nshe’s she, and I’m I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know\nall the things I used to know . Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four\ntimes six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to\ntwenty at that rate! However , the Multiplication Table doesn’ t signify: let’s\ntry Geography . London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\nRome, and Rome—no, that’s all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been\nchanged for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘How doth the little—’” and she crossed\nher hand s on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,\nbut her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the\nsame as they used to do:—“How doth the little crocodile\n    Improve his shining tail,\nAnd pour th",

No, I’ve made up my\nmind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be no use their putting\ntheir heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’  I shall only look up\nand say ‘Who am I then?

Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that\nperson, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down here till I’m somebody else’—\nbut, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, “I do wish they\nwould  put their heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!”\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surpris ed to see\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit’ s little white kid gloves while she was\ntalking. “How can I have done that?” she thought. “I must be growing small\nagain.” She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found\nthat, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and\nwas going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this\nwas the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily , just in time to avoid\nshrinking away altogether .\n“That was a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself sti",

And I declare it’s too bad,\nthat it is!”\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!\nshe was up to her chin in salt water . Her first idea was that she had\nsomehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by railway ,”\nshe said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and hadcome to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English\ncoast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children\ndigging in ",
    "ad been to the seaside once in her life, and hadcome to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English\ncoast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children\ndigging in the sand with wooden  spades, then a row of lodging houses, and\nbehind them a railway station.) However , she soon made out that she was in\nthe pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.\n“I wish I hadn’ t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about,  trying to\nfind her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppos e, by being\ndrowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be sure! However ,\neverything is queer to-day .”\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off,\nand she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be\na walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was\nnow, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in\nlike herself.\n“Would it be of any use, now,” tho",
    " it must be\na walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was\nnow, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in\nlike herself.\n“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it\ncan talk: at any rate, there’ s no harm in trying.” So she began: “O Mouse,\ndo you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about\nhere, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a\nmouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she rememb ered having\nseen in her brother ’s Latin Grammar , “A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse\n—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather inqui sitively , and\nseemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.\n“Perhaps it doesn’ t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s a\nFrench mouse, come over with William the Conqueror .” (For, with all her\nknowledge of history , Ali",
    "yes, but it said nothing.\n“Perhaps it doesn’ t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s a\nFrench mouse, come over with William the Conqueror .” (For, with all her\nknowledge of history , Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything\nhad happ ened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which was the first\nsentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of\nthe water , and seemed to quiver all over with fright. “Oh, I beg your\npardon!” cried Alice hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor animal’ s\nfeelings. “I quite for got you didn’ t like cats.”\n“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\nyou like cats if you were me?”\n“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’ t be angry about\nit. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d take a\nfancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,” Alicewent on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, “and she sit",

Our family always hated  cats:\nnasty , low , vulgar things! Don’ t let me hear the name again!”\n“I won’ t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\nconversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\nanswer , so Alice went on eagerl y: “There is such a nice little dog near our\nhouse I sho",

And it’ll fetch things when you throw them,\nand it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner , and all sorts of things—I can’t\nremember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer , you know , and he says\nit’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and—\noh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, “I’m afraid I’ve offended it\nagain!” For the Mouse was swim ming away from her as hard as it could go,\nand making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\nSo she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\nwon’ t talk about cats or dogs either , if you don’t like them! ” When the\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was\nquite ",
    "t, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\nwon’ t talk about cats or dogs either , if you don’t like them! ” When the\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was\nquite pale (with passion, Alice  thought), and it said in a low trembling\nvoice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my history , and you’ll\nunderstand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a\nLory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way,\nand the whole party swam to the shore.CHAPTER III.\nA Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\nThey were indeed a queer -looking party that assembled on the bank—the\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clingi ng close to\nthem, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\nThe first questi on of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\nconsultation about this, and after ",
    " animals with their fur clingi ng close to\nthem, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\nThe first questi on of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to\nAlice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them\nall her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory , who at last\nturned sulky, and would only say, “I am older than you, and must know\nbetter;” and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,\nand, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be\nsaid.\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed  to be a person of authority among them,\ncalled out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I’ll soon make you dry\nenough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the\nmiddle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would\ncatch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n“Ahem!” said the Mouse wi",
    "once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the\nmiddle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would\ncatch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This\nis the driest thing I know . Silence all round, if you please! ‘William the\nConqueror , whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to\nby the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed\nto usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar , the earls of Mercia and\nNorthumbria—’”\n“Ugh!” said the Lory , with a shiver .\n“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did\nyou speak?”“Not I!” said the Lory hastily .\n“I thoug ht you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar ,\nthe earls  of Mercia and Northu mbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,\nthe patriotic archbishop of Canterbury , found it advisable—’”\n“Found what ?” said the Duck.\n“Found it,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of cour",
    "nd Northu mbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,\nthe patriotic archbishop of Canterbury , found it advisable—’”\n“Found what ?” said the Duck.\n“Found it,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know what\n‘it’ means.”\n“I know  what ‘it’ means well enough, when I find a thing,” said the\nDuck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\narchbishop find?”\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the\ncrown. William’ s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his\nNormans—’  How are you gettin g on now, my dear?” it continued, turning\nto Alice as it spoke.\n“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’ t seem to dry\nme at all.”\n“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly , rising to its feet, “I move that the\nmeeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more ener getic remedies—”\n“Speak English !” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning",
    "e,” said the Dodo solemnly , rising to its feet, “I move that the\nmeeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more ener getic remedies—”\n“Speak English !” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half\nthose long words, and, what’ s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And the\nEaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered\naudibly .\n“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was, that\nthe best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”\n“What is a Caucu s-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to know ,\nbut the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody  ought to speak,  and\nno one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n“Why ,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And, as\nyou might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how\nthe Dodo managed it.)\nFirst it marked out a race-cour se, in a sort of circle, (“the exact shape\ndoesn’ t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were ",
    "yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how\nthe Dodo managed it.)\nFirst it marked out a race-cour se, in a sort of circle, (“the exact shape\ndoesn’ t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course,\nhere and there. There was no “One, two, three, and away ,” but they beganrunning when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not\neasy to know when the race was over. However , when they had been\nrunning half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly\ncalled out “The race is over!” and they all crowded round it, panting, and\nasking, “But who has won?”\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,\nand it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the\nposition in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him),\nwhile the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, “ Everybody  has won,\nand all must have prizes.”\n“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked",

At last the Dodo said, “ Everybody  has won,\nand all must have prizes.”\n“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.\n“Why , she, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;\nand the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused\nway, “Prizes! Prizes!”\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got\ninto it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all\nround.\n“But she must have a prize herself, you know ,” said the Mouse.\n“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely . “What else have you got in\nyour pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.\n“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly .\n“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\npresented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant\nthimble",
    " said Alice sadly .\n“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\npresented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant\nthimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked  so grave\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say,\nshe simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and\nthe smal l ones choked and had to be patted on the back. How ever, it was\nover at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell\nthem something more.“You promised to tell me your history , you know ,” said Alice, “and why\nit is you hate—C  and D,” she added in a whisper , half afraid that it would\nbe of fended again.\n“Mine is a long and a ",
    "ng more.“You promised to tell me your history , you know ,” said Alice, “and why\nit is you hate—C  and D,” she added in a whisper , half afraid that it would\nbe of fended again.\n“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\nsighing.\n“It is a long tail, certainly ,” said Alice, looking down with wonder at the\nMouse’ s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on puzzling about\nit while the Mou se was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something\nlike this:—\n         “Fury said to a\n         mouse, That he\n        met in the\n       house,\n     ‘Let us\n      both go to\n       law: I will\n        prosecute\n         you.—Come,\n           I’ll take no\n           denial; We\n          must have a\n        trial: For\n      really this\n     morning I’ve\n    nothing\n    to do.’\n      Said the\n      mouse to the\n       cur, ‘Such\n        a trial,\n         dear sir,\n            With\n          no jury\n        or judge,\n       would be\n      wasting\n      our\n   ",
    "ing\n    to do.’\n      Said the\n      mouse to the\n       cur, ‘Such\n        a trial,\n         dear sir,\n            With\n          no jury\n        or judge,\n       would be\n      wasting\n      our\n      breath.’\n        ‘I’ll be\n        judge, I’ll\n         be jury,’\n             Said\n         cunning\n          old Fury:\n          ‘I’ll\n          try the\n            whole\n            cause,\n              and\n           condemn\n           you\n          to\n           death.’”“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely . “What are you\nthinking of?”\n“I beg your pardon,” said Alice  very humbly: “you had got to the fifth\nbend, I think?”\n“I had not!” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily .\n“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\nanxiously about her . “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”\n“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and walking\naway . “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”\n“I didn’ t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice.

Let this be a lesso n to you never to lose your temper! ” “Hold\nyour tongue, Ma!” said the youn g Crab, a little snappishly . “You’re enough\nto try the patience of an oyster!”\n“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud, addressing\nnobody in particular . “She’d soon fetch it back!”\n“And who is Dinah, if I migh t venture to ask the question",
    "ce of an oyster!”\n“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud, addressing\nnobody in particular . “She’d soon fetch it back!”\n“And who is Dinah, if I migh t venture to ask the question?” said the\nLory .\nAlice replied eagerly , for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\n“Dinah’ s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you can’t\nthink! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why , she’ll eat a\nlittle bird as soon as look at it!”\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party . Some of the\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\ncarefully , remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn’ t\nsuit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children,\n“Come away , my dears! It’s high time you were all in bed!” On various\npretexts they all moved of f, and Alice was soon left alone.“I wish I hadn’ t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy\ntone. “Nobody see",
    "s! It’s high time you were all in bed!” On various\npretexts they all moved of f, and Alice was soon left alone.“I wish I hadn’ t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy\ntone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best cat\nin the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any\nmore!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and\nlow-spirited. In a little while, however , she again heard a little pattering of\nfootsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly , half hoping that the\nMouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story .CHAPTER IV.\nThe Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it\nmuttering to itself “The Duches s! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my\nfur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!\nWhere can I have dropped them, I wonder",
    "nd she heard it\nmuttering to itself “The Duches s! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my\nfur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!\nWhere can I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a moment\nthat it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very\ngood-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be\nseen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and\nthe great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished\ncompletely .\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called\nout to her in an angry tone, “Why , Mary Ann, what ar e you doing out here?\nRun home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick,\nnow!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the\ndirection it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.\n“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How\nsurprised he’ll be when he f",
    "she ran off at once in the\ndirection it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.\n“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How\nsurprised he’ll be when he finds  out who I am! But I’d better take him his\nfan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she came upon\na neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the\nname “W. RABBIT ,” engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and\nhurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and\nbe turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.\n“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for a\nrabbit! I suppose  Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she began\nfancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come heredirectly , and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute, nurse! But I’ve\ngot to see that the mouse doesn’ t get out.’ Only I don’t think,” Alice went\non, “that th",
    "d happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come heredirectly , and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute, nurse! But I’ve\ngot to see that the mouse doesn’ t get out.’ Only I don’t think,” Alice went\non, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about\nlike that!”\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in\nthe wind ow, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny\nwhite kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just\ngoing to leave the room, when  her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood\nnear the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words\n“DRINK ME,” but nevertheles s she uncorked it and put it to her lips. “I\nknow something  interesting is sure to happe n,” she said to herself,\n“whenever I eat or drink anythin g; so I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do\nhope it’ll make me grow large again, for really I’m quite tired of being such\na tiny little thing!”\nIt did so indeed, and ",
    "enever I eat or drink anythin g; so I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do\nhope it’ll make me grow large again, for really I’m quite tired of being such\na tiny little thing!”\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and\nhad to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the\nbottle, saying to herself “That’ s quite enough—I hope I shan’t grow any\nmore—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’ t drunk quite\nso much!”\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and\nvery soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not\neven room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow\nagainst the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on\ngrowing, and, as a last resource , she put one arm out of the window , and\none foot up the chimney , and said to herself “Now I can do no more,",
    "d the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on\ngrowing, and, as a last resource , she put one arm out of the window , and\none foot up the chimney , and said to herself “Now I can do no more,\nwhatever happens. What will become of me?”\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and\nshe grew  no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to\nbe no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder\nshe felt unhappy .\n“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’ t\nalways growing larger and smaller , and being ordered about by mice and\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn’ t gone down that rabbit-hole—an d yet—and\nyet—it’ s rather curious, you know , this sort of life! I do wond er what can\nhave happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind ofthing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought\nto be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow",
    "to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind ofthing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought\nto be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I’ll\nwrite one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a sorrowful tone; “at least\nthere’ s no room to grow up any more her e.”\n“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I never  get any older than I am now?\nThat’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman— but then—\nalways to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’ t like that! ”\n“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn\nlessons in here? Why , there’ s hardly room for you, and no room at all for\nany lesson-books!”\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other , and making\nquite a conversa tion of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a\nvoice outside, and stopped to listen.\n“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this\nmoment!” Then came a little pattering of feet on the stair",
    "her; but after a few minutes she heard a\nvoice outside, and stopped to listen.\n“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this\nmoment!” Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it\nwas the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as\nthe Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the\ndoor opened inwards, and Alice’ s elbow was pressed hard against it, that\nattempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll go round and\nget in at the window .”\n“ That you won’ t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she\nheard the Rabbi t just under the window , she suddenly spread out her hand,\nand made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard\na little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she\nconcluded that it was just p",

She did not get hold of anything, but she heard\na little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she\nconcluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber -frame, or\nsomething of the sort.\nNext came an angry voice—th e Rabbit’ s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?”\nAnd then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging\nfor apples, yer honour!”\n“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily . “Here! Come and\nhelp me out of this!” (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n“Now tell me, Pat, what’ s that in the window?”\n“Sure, it’ s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why , it fills the whole\nwindow!”\n“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’ s an arm for all that.”\n“Well, it’ s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\nnow and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like ",
    "or all that.”\n“Well, it’ s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\nnow and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour , at all, at all!” “Do\nas I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her hand  again, and\nmade another snatch in the air. This time there were two little shrieks, and\nmore sounds of broken glass. “What a number of cucumber -frames there\nmust be!” thoug ht Alice. “I wonder what they’ll do next! As for pulling me\nout of the window , I only wish they could!  I’m sure I don’t want to stay in\nhere any longer!”\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\ntalking together: she made out the words: “Where’ s the other ladder?—\nWhy , I hadn’ t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill! fetch it here, lad!\n—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em together first—they don’t\nre",

Y ou do it!— That I won’t, then!— Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the\nmaster says you’re to go down the chimney!”\n“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney , has he?” said Alice to\nherself. “Shy , they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’ t be in Bill’s\nplace for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow , to be sure; but I think  I can\nkick a little!”\nShe drew  her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\nshe heard a little animal (she couldn’ t guess of what sort it was) scrat",
    "rrow , to be sure; but I think  I can\nkick a little!”\nShe drew  her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\nshe heard a little animal (she couldn’ t guess of what sort it was) scratching\nand scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to\nherself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what\nwould happen next.\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!” then\nthe Rabbit’ s voice along—“Catc h him, you by the hedge!” then silence, and\nthen another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don’ tchoke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all\nabout it!”\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’ s Bill,” thought Alice,)\n“Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m a deal\ntoo flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-\nin-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”\n“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.\n“We must burn the house d",

If they had any sense,  they’d take the roof\noff.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard\nthe Rabbit say , “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\n“A barrowful of what? ” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for\nthe next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window ,\nand some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to this,”  she said to\nherself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that again!” which produced\nanother dead silence.\nAlice noticed with some surpri se that the pebbles were all turning into\nlittle cakes a",

As soon as she was small enough to get through\nthe door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals\nand birds waitin g outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle,\nbeing held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a\nbottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran\noff as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.\n“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to her",
    " a\nbottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran\noff as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.\n“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she wandered\nabout in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing\nis to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.”\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how toset about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a\nlittle sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry .\nAn enormous puppy was lookin g down at her with large round eyes, and\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little thing!” said\nAlice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was\nterribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry , in\nwhich case it would be very lik",
    "tle thing!” said\nAlice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was\nterribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry , in\nwhich case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\nHardly knowing  what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held\nit out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet\nat once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to\nworry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from\nbeing run over; and the momen t she appeared on the other side, the puppy\nmade another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to\nget hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play\nwith a cart-horse, and expectin g every moment to be trampled under its\nfeet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short\ncharges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a lon",

Alice looked all round her at the\nflowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like\nthe right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large\nmushroom grow ing near her, about the same height as herself; and when\nshe had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to\nher that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\nmushroom, and her eyes immed iately met those of a large blue caterpillar ,\nthat was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long\nhookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.CHAPTER V.\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\nThe Caterpillar and Ali",

Alice replied,\nrather shyly , “I—I hardly know , sir, just at present—at least I know who I\nwas when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed\nseveral times since then.”\n“What do you mean by that? ” said the Caterpillar sternly . “Explain\nyourself!”\n“I can’t explain myself , I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m not\nmyself, you see.”\n“I don’ t see,” said the Caterpillar .\n“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly ,” Alice replied very politely , “for I\ncan’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different siz",

For some\nminutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms,\ntook the hookah  out of its mouth again, and said, “So you think you’re\nchanged, do you?”\n“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Al",

    " I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one\ndoesn’ t like changing so often, you know .”\n“I don’t know ,” said the Caterpillar .\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper .\n“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar .“Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn’ t mind,” said\nAlice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”\n“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily , rearing\nitself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\nthought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’ t be so easily of fended!”\n“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah\ninto its mouth and began smoking again.\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.

In a minute\nor two the Cater pillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or\ntwice, and shoo k itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled\naway in the grass, merely rema rking as it went, “One side will make you\ngrow taller , and the other side will make you grow shorter .”\n“One side of what?  The other side of what? ” thought Alice to herself.\n“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar , just as if she had asked it aloud;\nand in another moment it was out of sight.\nAlice remained  looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly\nround, she found this a very difficult question. However , at last she\nstretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of\nthe edge with each hand.\n“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the\n",

However , at last she\nstretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of\nthe edge with each hand.\n“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the\nright-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow\nunderneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to\nwork at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was presse d so closely\nagainst her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did\nit at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *“Come, my head’ s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delig ht, which\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could ",
    "*      *      *“Come, my head’ s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delig ht, which\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an\nimmense length  of neck, which  seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of\ngreen leaves that lay far below her .\n“What can all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where have  my\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?” She\nwas moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow , except\na little shaking among the distant green leaves.\nAs there  seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she\ntried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck\nwould bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.

She had just\nsucceeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive\nin among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees\nunder which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw\nback in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her\nviolently with its wings.\n“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.\n“I’m not a serpent!” said Alice indignantly . “Let me alone!”\n“Serpent, I say again!” repeated  the Pigeon, but in a more subd ued tone,\nand added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothi ng seems to\nsuit them!”\n“I haven’ t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.\n“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried hedges,”\nthe Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those serpents! There’ s\nno pleasing them!”\nAlice was more and more puzz led, but she thought there was no use in\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n“As if it wasn’ t trouble",
    "her; “but those serpents! There’ s\nno pleasing them!”\nAlice was more and more puzz led, but she thought there was no use in\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n“As if it wasn’ t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon; “but I\nmust be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why , I haven’ t had a\nwink of sleep these three weeks!”\n“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to\nsee its meaning.\n“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” conti nued the\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking  I should befree of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky!\nUgh, Serpent!”\n“But I’m not a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”\n“Well! What  are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to invent\nsomething!”\n“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully , as she remembered the\nnumber of changes she had gone through that day .\n“A likely story indeed!” said the Pige",

No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’ s no use denying it.\nI suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!”\n“I have  tasted eggs, certainly ,” said Alice, who was a very truthful child;\n“but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know .”\n“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then they’re a\nkind of serpent, that’ s all I can say .”\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute\nor two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re looking\nfor eggs, I know  that well enough; and what does it matter to me whether\nyou’re a little girl or a serpent?”\n“It matte rs a good deal to ",
    "ch gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re looking\nfor eggs, I know  that well enough; and what does it matter to me whether\nyou’re a little girl or a serpent?”\n“It matte rs a good deal to me,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not looking\nfor eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’ t want yours : I don’t like\nthem raw .”\n“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down\nagain into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she\ncould, for her neck kept getting  entangled among the branches, and every\nnow and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered\nthat she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work\nvery carefully , nibbling first at one and then at the other , and growing\nsometimes taller and sometimes shorter , until she had succeeded in bringing\nherself down to her usual height.\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt\nquite strange at first; but sh",
    "nd sometimes shorter , until she had succeeded in bringing\nherself down to her usual height.\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt\nquite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began\ntalking to herse lf, as usual. “Come, there’ s half my plan done  now! How\npuzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m going to be, from\none minute to another! However , I’ve got back to my right size: the nextthing is, to get into that beau tiful garden—how is that to be done, I\nwonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a\nlittle house in it about four feet high. “Whoever lives there,” thought Alice,\n“it’ll never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out\nof their wits!” So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not\nventure to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine\ninches high.CHAPTER VI.\nPig and Pepper\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the h",
    "ing at the righthand bit again, and did not\nventure to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine\ninches high.CHAPTER VI.\nPig and Pepper\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\nwood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)—and\nrapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another\nfootman in livery , with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both\nfootmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads.\nShe felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way\nout of the wood to listen.\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter ,\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other , saying, in a\nsolemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play\ncroquet.” The Frog",
    "om under his arm a great letter ,\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other , saying, in a\nsolemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play\ncroquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only\nchanging the order of the words a little, “From the Queen. An invitation for\nthe Duchess to play croquet.”\nThen they both bowed low , and their curls got entangled together .\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for\nfear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman\nwas gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring\nstupidly up into the sky .\nAlice went timidly up to the door , and knocked.\n“There’ s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for two\nreasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you are;\nsecondly , becaus e they’re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly\nhear you.” And certainly there was a most  extraordinary n",
    "ns. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you are;\nsecondly , becaus e they’re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly\nhear you.” And certainly there was a most  extraordinary noise going onwithin—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great\ncrash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\n“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”\n“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on\nwithout attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance, if\nyou were inside , you might knock, and I could let you out, you know .” He\nwas looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice\nthought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,” she said to\nherself; “his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he\nmight answer questions.—How am I to get in?” she repeated, aloud.\n“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”\nAt this moment  the door of the house opene",
    "of his head. But at any rate he\nmight answer questions.—How am I to get in?” she repeated, aloud.\n“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”\nAt this moment  the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\nskimming out, straight at the Footman’ s head: it just grazed his nose, and\nbroke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\nas if nothing had happened.\n“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n“ Ar e you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’ s the first question,\nyou know .”\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really\ndreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue. It’s\nenough to drive one crazy!”\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\nremark, with variations. “I shall  sit here,” he said, “on and off, for days and\ndays.”\n“But what am I to do?” said Alice.\n“Anything you like,” said the Fo",
    "nk this a good opportunity for repeating his\nremark, with variations. “I shall  sit here,” he said, “on and off, for days and\ndays.”\n“But what am I to do?” said Alice.\n“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.\n“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s\nperfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke  from one\nend to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the\nmiddle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large\ncauldron which seemed to be full of soup.“There’ s certain ly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to herself, as\nwell as she could for sneezing.\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duches s sneezed\noccasionally; and as for the baby , it was sneezing and howling alternately\nwithout a moment’ s pause.

The only things in the kitchen that did not\nsneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and\ngrinning from ear to ear .\n“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly , for she was not\nquite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why your cat\ngrins like that?”\n“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’ s why . Pig!”\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped;\nbut she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby , and not to\nher, so she took courage, and went on again:—\n“I didn’ t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’ t know\nthat cats could  grin.”\n“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\n“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely , feeling quite\npleased to have got into a conversation.\n“You don’ t know much,” said the Duchess; “and",
    " said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\n“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely , feeling quite\npleased to have got into a conversation.\n“You don’ t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’ s a fact.”\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be\nas well to intro duce some other subject of conversation. While she was\ntrying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at\nonce set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and\nthe baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,\nplates, and dishe s. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit\nher; and the baby was howling so much already , that it was quite impossible\nto say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n“Oh, please  mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down\nin an agony of terror . “Oh, there goes his pr ecious  nose!” as an unusually\nlarge saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it of f.\n“If",
    "what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down\nin an agony of terror . “Oh, there goes his pr ecious  nose!” as an unusually\nlarge saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it of f.\n“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse\ngrowl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”“Which would not be an advantage ,” said Alice, who felt very glad to get\nan opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just think of what\nwork it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-\nfour hours to turn round on its axis—”\n“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop of f her head!”\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the\nhint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be\nlistening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I think ; or is it twelve?\nI—”\n“Oh, don’t bother me,” said the Duch ess; “I never could abide figures!”\nAnd with that she began nursing  her child a",
    "istening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I think ; or is it twelve?\nI—”\n“Oh, don’t bother me,” said the Duch ess; “I never could abide figures!”\nAnd with that she began nursing  her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to\nit as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:\n“Speak roughly to your little boy ,\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\nHe only does it to annoy ,\n    Because he knows it teases.”\nCHORUS.\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\nWhile the Duch ess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\nthe baby violently up and down , and the poor little thing howled so, that\nAlice could hardly hear the words:—\n“I speak severely to my boy ,\n    I beat him when he sneezes;\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\n    The pepper when he pleases!”\nCHORUS.\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\n“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play\ncroquet with the Quee",

The cook threw a\nfrying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her .Alice caught the baby with some difficulty , as it was a queer -shaped little\ncreature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, “just like a star-\nfish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine\nwhen she caugh t it, and kept doubling itself up and straighteni ng itself out\nagain, so that altogether , for the first minute or two, it was as much as she\ncould do to hold it.\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and\nleft foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open\nair. “If I don’t take this child away ",
    "\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and\nleft foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open\nair. “If I don’t take this child away with me,” thought Alice, “they’re sure to\nkill it in a day or two: wouldn’ t it be murder to leave it behind?” She said\nthe last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off\nsneezing by this time). “Don’ t grunt,” said Alice; “that’ s not at all a proper\nway of expressing yourself.”\nThe baby grunte d again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to\nsee what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a very\nturn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were\ngetting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of\nthe thing at all. “But perhaps it was only sobbing,” she thought,  and looked\ninto its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.\nNo, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a ",
    "the look of\nthe thing at all. “But perhaps it was only sobbing,” she thought,  and looked\ninto its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.\nNo, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,” said\nAlice, seriously , “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!” The\npoor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which),\nand they went on for some while in silence.\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now , what am I to do with\nthis creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so violently , that\nshe looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be no\nmistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it\nwould be quite absurd for her to carry it further .\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot\naway quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to herself, “it\nwould have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome\npig, ",
    "re down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot\naway quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to herself, “it\nwould have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome\npig, I think.” And she began thinking over other children she knew , who\nmight do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, “if one only\nknew the right way to change them—” when she was a little startled by\nseeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards of f.The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\nthought: still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it\nought to be treated with respect.\n“Cheshire Puss, ” she began, rather timidly , as she did not at all know\nwhether it would like the name: however , it only grinned a little wider .\n“Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on. “Would you tell\nme, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\n“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said t",
    "ttle wider .\n“Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on. “Would you tell\nme, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\n“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.\n“I don’ t much care where—” said Alice.\n“Then it doesn’ t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.\n“—so long as I get somewher e,” Alice added as an explanation.\n“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long\nenough.”\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.\n“What sort of people live about here?”\n“In that directio n,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives a\nHatter: and in that direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a March Hare.\nVisit either you like: they’re both mad.”\n“But I don’ t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.\n“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.\nYou’re mad.”\n“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.\n“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’ t have come here.”\nAlice ",
    "arked.\n“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.\nYou’re mad.”\n“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.\n“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’ t have come here.”\nAlice didn’ t think that proved it at all; however , she went on “And how\ndo you know that you’re mad?”\n“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’ s not mad. You grant that?”\n“I suppose so,” said Alice.\n“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry ,\nand wags its tail when it’s please d. Now I growl when I’m pleased, and wag\nmy tail when I’m angry . Therefore I’m mad.”\n“ I call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.\n“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet  with the\nQueen to-day?”“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’ t been invited yet.”\n“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it\nsuddenly",
    "ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it\nsuddenly appeared again.\n“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly\nforgotten to ask.”\n“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a\nnatural way .\n“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.\nAlice waited a little, half expec ting to see it again, but it did not appear ,\nand after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March\nHare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she said to herself; “the\nMarch Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it\nwon’ t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was in March.”  As she said\nthis, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a\ntree.\n“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.\n“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you w",
    " it was in March.”  As she said\nthis, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a\ntree.\n“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.\n“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’ t keep appe aring and\nvanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy .”\n“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly , beginning\nwith the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some\ntime after the rest of it had gone.\n“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a grin\nwithout a cat! It’ s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was\nso large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some\nmore of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet\nhigh: even then she walked",
    "ed with fur. It was\nso large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some\nmore of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet\nhigh: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly , sayin g to herself\n“Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I’d gone to see the\nHatter instead!”CHAPTER VII.\nA Mad Tea-Party\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March\nHare and the Hatter were havin g tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between\nthem, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their\nelbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very uncomfortable for the\nDormouse,” thought Alice; “only , as it’ s asleep, I suppose it doesn’ t mind.”\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded togeth er at one\ncorner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw Alice\ncoming. “There’ s plenty  of room!” said Alice indignantl y, and she sat down\nin a lar ge arm-chair at ",

No room!” they cried out when they saw Alice\ncoming. “There’ s plenty  of room!” said Alice indignantl y, and she sat down\nin a lar ge arm-chair at one end of the table.\n“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. “I\ndon’t see any wine,” she remarked.\n“There isn’ t any ,” said the March Hare.\n“Then it wasn’ t very civil of you to of fer it,” said Alice angrily .\n“It wasn’ t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said the\nMarch Hare.\n“I didn’t know it was your table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great many\nmore than three.”\n“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter . He had been looking at Alice\nfor some time with great curiosity , and this was his first speech.\n“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some\nseverity; “it’ s very rude.”The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said was,",
    " this was his first speech.\n“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some\nseverity; “it’ s very rude.”The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said was,\n“Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”\n“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve\nbegun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.\n“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said the\nMarch Hare.\n“Exactly so,” said Alice.\n“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.\n“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I say—that’ s\nthe same thing, you know .”\n“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter . “You might just as well say\nthat ‘I see what I eat’  is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”\n“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what I\nget’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”\n“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seem ed to be\ntalking in his sle",
    "ght just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what I\nget’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”\n“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seem ed to be\ntalking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’  is the same thing as ‘I\nsleep when I breathe’!”\n“It is the same thing with you,” said the Hatter , and here the conversa tion\ndropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all\nshe could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn’ t much.\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month is\nit?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and\nwas looking at it uneasily , shaki ng it every now and then, and holding it to\nhis ear .\nAlice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”\n“Two days wron g!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn ’t suit the\nworks!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n“It was the best butter ,” the March Hare meekly replied.\n“Yes, but",
    "th.”\n“Two days wron g!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn ’t suit the\nworks!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n“It was the best butter ,” the March Hare meekly replied.\n“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:\n“you shouldn’ t have put it in with the bread-knife.”\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing\nbetter to say than his first remark, “It was the best butter , you know .”Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity . “What a\nfunny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’ t tell\nwhat o’clock it is!”\n“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter . “Does your watch tell you what\nyear it is?”\n“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it stays\nthe same year for such a long time together .”\n“Which is just the case with mine ,” said the Hatter .\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled, T",
    "se not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it stays\nthe same year for such a long time together .”\n“Which is just the case with mine ,” said the Hatter .\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled, The Hatter ’s remark seemed to have no sort\nof meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite  understand\nyou,” she said, as politely as she could.\n“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter , and he poured a little\nhot tea upon its nose.\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently , and said, without opening its\neyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”\n“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning  to Alice\nagain.\n“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’ s the answer?”\n“I haven’ t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter .\n“Nor I,” said the March Hare.\nAlice sighed wearily . “I think you might do something better  with the\ntime,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.”\n“If you knew Time as well as I do,” sa",

It’s him.”\n“I don’ t know what you mean,” said Alice.\n“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head contem ptuously .\n“I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”\n“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat time\nwhen I learn music.”\n“Ah! that accoun ts for it,” said the Hatter . “He won’ t stand beating. Now ,\nif you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anythin g you liked\nwith the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in the morning,\njust time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and\nround goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!”(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper .)\n“That would be grand, certainly ,” sa",
    "sper a hint to Time, and\nround goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!”(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper .)\n“That would be grand, certainly ,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I\nshouldn’ t be hungry for it, you know .”\n“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to half-past\none as long as you liked.”\n“Is that the way you manage?” Alice asked.\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully . “Not I!” he replied. “We\nquarrelled last March—just before he went mad, you know—” (poin ting\nwith his tea spoon at the March  Hare,) “—it was at the great concert given\nby the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\nHow I wonder what you’re at!’\nYou know the song, perhaps?”\n“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.\n“It goes on, you know ,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—\n‘Up above the world you fly ,\nLike a tea-tray in the sky .\n                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”\nHere the Dormouse shook itself",

Off with his\nhead!’”\n“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.\n“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’ t\ndo a thing I ask! It’ s always six o’clock now .”\nA bright  idea came into Alice’ s head. “Is that the reason so many tea-\nthings are put out here?” she asked.\n“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter  with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time, and\nwe’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”\n“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.\n“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”“",

I vote the young lady tells us a story .”\n“I’m afraid I don’ t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal.\n“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormou se!” And\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’ t asleep,” he said in a\nhoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”\n“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.\n“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.\n“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter , “or you’ll be asleep again\nbefore it’ s done.”\n“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began in\na great hurry; “an",
    "” pleaded Alice.\n“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter , “or you’ll be asleep again\nbefore it’ s done.”\n“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began in\na great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived\nat the bottom of a well—”\n“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest in\nquestions of eating and drinking.\n“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\ntwo.\n“They couldn’ t have done that, you know ,” Alice gently remarked;\n“they’d have been ill.”\n“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “ very ill.”\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of living\nwould be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But why did\nthey live at the bottom of a well?”\n“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly .\n“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t take\nmore.”\n“You mean you can’t take less,” said the Hatter: “it’s ver",
    " more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly .\n“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t take\nmore.”\n“You mean you can’t take less,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to take\nmore than nothing.”\n“Nobody asked your opinion,” said Alice.\n“Who’ s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly .Alice did not quite know what  to say to this: so she helped herself to\nsome tea and bread-and-butter , and then turned to the Dormouse, and\nrepeated her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\nsaid, “It was a treacle-well.”\n“There’ s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily , but the Hatter\nand the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, “If\nyou can’ t be civil, you’d better finish the story for yourself.”\n“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’ t interrupt again. I\ndare say there may be one.”\n“One, indeed!” said the Dormous",
    "f\nyou can’ t be civil, you’d better finish the story for yourself.”\n“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’ t interrupt again. I\ndare say there may be one.”\n“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly . However , he consented to\ngo on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw , you\nknow—”\n“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite for getting her promise.\n“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\n“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place\non.”\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March\nHare moved into the Dormouse’ s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took\nthe place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\nadvantage from  the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\ncautiously: “But I don’ t understand. Where did they",
    "e off than\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\ncautiously: “But I don’ t understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?”\n“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”\n“But they were in the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to\nnotice this last remark.\n“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\nsome time without interrupting it.\n“They were learning to draw ,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and\nrubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew  all manner\nof things—everything that begins with an M—”“Why with an M?” said Alice.\n“Why not?” said the March Hare.\nAlice was silent.\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter ,",
    "an M—”“Why with an M?” said Alice.\n“Why not?” said the March Hare.\nAlice was silent.\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter , it woke up again with a little\nshriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the\nmoon, and memory , and muchness—you know you say things are “much of\na muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?”\n“Really , now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t think\n—”\n“Then you shouldn’ t talk,” said the Hatter .\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly , and\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though  she looked\nback once or twice, half hoping  that they would call after her: the last time\nshe saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.\n“At any rate I’ll never go there again!” said Alice as she picked",
    " twice, half hoping  that they would call after her: the last time\nshe saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.\n“At any rate I’ll never go there again!” said Alice as she picked her way\nthrough the wood. “It’ s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!”\nJust as she said this, she noticed  that one of the trees had a door leading\nright into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But everything’ s curious\ntoday . I think I may as well go in at once.” And in she went.\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass\ntable. “Now , I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself, and began by\ntaking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden.\nThen she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it\nin her pocket) till she was about  a foot high: then she walked down the little\npassage: and then—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among\nthe bright flower -beds and t",

Alice thoug ht this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch\nthem, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, “Look out\nnow, Five! Don’ t go splashing paint over me like that!”\n“I couldn’ t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my elbow .”\nOn which Seven looked up and said, “That’ s right, Five! Always lay the\nblame on others!”\n“ Y ou’d better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only yesterday\nyou deserved to be beheaded!”\n“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.\n“That’ s none of your business, Two!” said Seven.\n“Yes, it",
    "tter not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only yesterday\nyou deserved to be beheaded!”\n“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.\n“That’ s none of your business, Two!” said Seven.\n“Yes, it is his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for bringing\nthe cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust\nthings—” when  his eye chanced  to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and\nall of them bowed low .\n“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly , “why you are painting\nthose roses?”\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\nvoice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have  been a r ed\nrose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to\nfind it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know . So you see,Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this moment Five",
    "we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to\nfind it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know . So you see,Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this moment Five,\nwho had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out “The Queen!\nThe Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon\ntheir faces. Ther e was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round,\neager to see the Queen.\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three\ngardeners, oblon g and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the\nten courtiers; these were ornam ented all over with diamonds, and walked\ntwo and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there\nwere ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in\nhand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts.

    "mping merrily along hand in\nhand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the\nguests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the\nWhite Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner , smiling at\neverything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed\nthe Knave of Hearts, carrying the King’ s crown on a crimson velvet\ncushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND\nQUEEN OF HEAR TS.\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of\nsuch a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a\nprocession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so\nthat they couldn’ t see it?” So she stood still where she was, and waited.\nWhen the proces sion came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\nat her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the Knave\nof Hearts, who only",

I needn’ t\nbe afraid of them!”\n“And who are these? ” said the Quee n, pointing to the three gardeners\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their\nfaces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack,\nshe could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or\nthree of her own children.“How should I know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s no\nbusiness of mine .”\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring",

Of f—”\n“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly , and the Queen was\nsilent.\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Con sider , my\ndear: she is only a child!”\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn\nthem over!”\nThe Knave did so, very carefully , with one foot.\n“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners\ninstantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal\nchildren, and everybody else.\n“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy .” And then,\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What have  you been doing here?”\n“May it please your Majesty ,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going\ndown on one knee as he spok",

The three soldiers wandered about for a minute\nor two, looking for them, and then quietly marched of f after the others.\n“Are their heads of f?” shouted the Queen.\n“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted in\nreply .\n“That’ s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\nevidently meant for her .\n“Yes!” shouted Alice.\n“Come on, then!” roared th",
    "That’ s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\nevidently meant for her .\n“Yes!” shouted Alice.\n“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\nwondering very much what would happen next.“It’s—it’ s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\n“Very,” said Alice: “—where’ s the Duchess?”\n“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’ s under sentence\nof execution.”\n“What for?” said Alice.\n“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.\n“No, I didn’ t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said ‘What\nfor?’”\n“She boxed the Queen’ s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\nscream of laughter . “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone.\n“Th",

Alice gave a little\nscream of laughter . “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone.\n“The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the Queen\nsaid—”\n“Get to your places!” shouted  the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\nother; however , they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in\nher life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the\nmallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to\nstand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\nThe chief difficulty Alice found  at first was in managing her flamingo:\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away , comfortably enough, under\nher arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally , just as she had got its\nneck nicely s",

    " soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game\nindeed.The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarr elling all\nthe while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the\nQueen was in a furious passio n, and went stamping about, and shouting\n“Off with his head!” or “Of f with her head!” about once in a minute.\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, “and\nthen,” thought she, “what would  become of me? They’re dreadfully fond of\nbeheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’ s any one left alive!”\nShe was looking about for some  way of escape, and wondering whether\nshe could get away without being seen, when she noticed  a curious\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it\na minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself “It’s the\nCheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to t",
    "ance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it\na minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself “It’s the\nCheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.”\n“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\nenough for it to speak with.\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use\nspeaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one of\nthem.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down\nher flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had\nsomeone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of\nit now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a complaining\ntone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear oneself speak—and\nthey don’t seem  to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody\nattends to them—and you’ve no idea how confusing it",
    "and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear oneself speak—and\nthey don’t seem  to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody\nattends to them—and you’ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being\nalive; for instan ce, there’ s the arch I’ve got to go through next walking\nabout at the other end of the ground—and I should have croqueted the\nQueen’ s hedgehog just now , only it ran away when it saw mine coming!”\n“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.\n“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’ s so extremely—” Just then she noticed that\nthe Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, “—likely to win,\nthat it’ s hardly worth while finishing the game.”\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\n“Who ar e you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and looking\nat the Cat’ s head with great curiosity .“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to\nintroduce it.”\n“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however , it may ",

I wish you would\nhave this cat removed!”\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.\n“Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.\n“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly , and he hurried\noff.\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was\ngoing on, as she heard the Queen’ s voice in the distance, screaming with\npassion.

She had already heard  her sentence three of the players to be\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of\nthings at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which\nseemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with\nthe other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the\nother side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of\nway to fly up into a tree.\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\nwas over, and both the hedgeho gs were out of sight: “but it doesn’ t matter\nmuch,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from th",
    "e time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\nwas over, and both the hedgeho gs were out of sight: “but it doesn’ t matter\nmuch,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side of the\nground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape\nagain, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a\nlarge crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between theexecutioner , the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while\nall the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\nThe mom ent Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the\nquestion, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke\nat once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.\nThe executioner ’s argument was, that you couldn’ t cut off a head unless\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had t",
    "she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.\nThe executioner ’s argument was, that you couldn’ t cut off a head unless\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing\nbefore, and he wasn’ t going to begin at his time of life.\nThe King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\nbeheaded, and that you weren’ t to talk nonsense.\nThe Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’ t done abou t it in less\nthan no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last\nremark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the Duchess:\nyou’d better ask her about it.”\n“She’ s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”\nAnd the executioner went of f like an arrow .\nThe Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappe ared; so the\nKing and the executioner r",

I\nonly wish peopl e knew that: then they wouldn’ t be so sting y about it, you\nknow—”\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled\nwhen she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking about\nsomething, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t tell you just\nnow what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.”\n“Perhaps it hasn’ t one,” Alice ventured to remark.\n“Tut, tut, child!”  said the Duche ss. “Everything’ s got a moral, if only you\ncan find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’ s side as she spoke.\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\nDuchess was very ugly; and secondly , because s",
    " you\ncan find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’ s side as she spoke.\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\nDuchess was very ugly; and secondly , because she was exactly the right\nheight to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder , and it was an uncomfortablysharp chin. However , she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as\nshe could.\n“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up\nthe conversation a little.\n“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love, ’tis\nlove, that makes the world go round!’”\n“Somebody said,” Alice whisper ed, “that it’s done by everybody minding\ntheir own business!”\n“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her\nsharp little chin into Alice’ s shou lder as she added, “and the moral of that is\n—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.’”\n“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to herself.\n“I da",

Shall I try the experiment?”\n“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to\nhave the experiment tried.\n“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\nthe moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together .’”\n“Only mustard isn’ t a bird,” Alice remarked.\n“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of\nputting things!”\n“It’s a mineral, I think ,” said Alice.\n“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\neverything that Alice said; “ther e’s a large mustard-mine near here.

And the\nmoral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.’”\n“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,\n“it’s a vegetable. It doesn’ t look like one, but it is.”\n“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that is\n—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more simply\n—‘Never imagin e yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to\nothers that what you were or might have been was not otherwis e than what\nyou had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.’”“I think I should understand that better ,” Alice said very politely , “if I had\nit written down: but I can’ t quite follow it as you say it.”\n“That’ s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied, in a\npleased tone.\n“Pray don’ t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said Alice.",

Take your choice!”\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n“Let’ s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\nmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-\nground.\nThe other guests  had taken advantage of the Queen’ s absence, and were\nresting in the shade: however , the moment they saw her, they hurried back\nto the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’ s delay would cost\nthem their lives.\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with\nthe other players, and shouting “",

(If\nyou don’t know  what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy thing!”\nsaid the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to\nhear his history . I must go back and see after some executions I have\nordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice\ndid not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it\nwould be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so\nshe waited.\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed  its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said ",

Come on!”\n“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly\nafter it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer ,\nAlice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him\ndeeply . “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphonanswered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all his fancy , that:\nhe hasn’ t got no sorrow , you know .

Alice thought to\nherself, “I don’t see how he can ever finish, if he doesn’t begin.” But she\nwaited patiently .\n“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real\nTurtle.”\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\noccasional exclamation of “Hjc krrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.

Alice was very nearly getting up and\nsaying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story ,” but she could not help\nthinking there must  be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.\n“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly ,\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the sea.\nThe master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”\n“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’ t one?” Alice asked.\n“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle\nangrily: “really you are very dull!”\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,”\nadded the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice,\nwho felt ready to sink into the earth.

Never  heard of\nuglifying!” it exclaimed. “Y ou know what to beautify is, I suppose?”\n“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier .”\n“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify is,\nyou are a simpleton.”\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she\nturned to the Mock Turtle, and sa",

    "Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say .”\n“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws.\n“And how many  hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry\nto change the subject.\n“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so\non.”\n“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.\n“That’ s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:\n“because they lessen from day to day .”\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before\nshe made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been a\nholiday?”\n“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.\n“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly .\n“That’ s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided\ntone: “tell her something about the games now .”CHAPTER X.\nThe Lobster Quadrille\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply , and drew the back of one flapper across\nhi",
    ",” the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided\ntone: “tell her something about the games now .”CHAPTER X.\nThe Lobster Quadrille\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply , and drew the back of one flapper across\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs\nchoked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,” said the\nGryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At\nlast the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his\ncheeks, he went on again:—\n“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’ t,” said Alice)\n—“and perhaps  you were never even introduced to a lobste r—” (Alice\nbegan to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily , and said “No,\nnever”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster\nQuadrille is!”\n“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”\n“Why ,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the sea-shore\n—”\n“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turt",
    "ter\nQuadrille is!”\n“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”\n“Why ,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the sea-shore\n—”\n“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\nthen, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”\n“That generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.\n“—you advance twice—”\n“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.\n“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”\n“—change lobsters, and retire in same order ,” continued the Gryphon.\n“Then, you know ,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”\n“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air .“—as far out to sea as you can—”\n“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.\n“Turn a somersault in the sea!”  cried the Mock Turtle, caperin g wildly\nabout.\n“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\n“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock Turtle,\nsuddenly dropp",

Which shall sing?”\n“Oh, you sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve for gotten the words.”\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every  now and\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\nand sadly:—\n“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.\n“There’ s a por",

    "checked herself\nhastily .\n“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve\nseen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”\n“I believ e so,” Alice replied thoughtfully . “They have their tails in their\nmouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”\n“You’re wrong about the crumb s,” said the Mock Turtle: “crum bs would\nall wash off in the sea. But they have  their tails in their mouths; and the\nreason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.—“T ell her\nabout the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.\n“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they would  go with the lobsters\nto the dance. So they got thrown  out to sea. So they had to fall a long way.\nSo they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn’ t get them out\nagain. That’ s all.”\n“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much\nabout a whiting before.”\n“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon.  “Do you\nknow why it’ s called a whiting?”\n“I ",
    "k you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much\nabout a whiting before.”\n“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon.  “Do you\nknow why it’ s called a whiting?”\n“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”\n“It does the boots and shoes ,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly .\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated\nin a wondering tone.\n“Why , what are your shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what\nmakes them so shiny?”\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\nanswer . “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”\n“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\n“are done with a whiting. Now you know .”\n“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity .“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: “any\nshrimp could have told you that.”\n“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still running\non the song, “I’d ",
    ".“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: “any\nshrimp could have told you that.”\n“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still running\non the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back, pleas e: we don’t\nwant you with us!’”\n“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”\n“Wouldn’ t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\n“Of course not,” said the Mock  Turtle: “why , if a fish came to me, and\ntold me he was going a journey , I should say ‘W ith what porpoise?’”\n“Don’ t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.\n“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the\nGryphon added “Come, let’ s hear some of your adventures.”\n“I could tell you my adventur es—beginning from this morning,” said\nAlice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday , because I was\na different person then.”\n“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.\n“No, no!",
    "ntur es—beginning from this morning,” said\nAlice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday , because I was\na different person then.”\n“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.\n“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\n“explanations take such a dreadful time.”\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two\ncreatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and\nmouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners\nwere perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating “You are old,\nFather William ,” to the Caterpi llar, and the words all coming different, and\nthen the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’ s very curious.”\n“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.\n“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully . “I should\nlike to hear her try and re",
    "ath, and said “That’ s very curious.”\n“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.\n“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully . “I should\nlike to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin. ” He looked\nat the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.\n“Stand up and repeat ‘’ Tis the voice of the sluggar d,’” said the Gryphon.\n“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!”\nthought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However , she got up,\nand bega n to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, thatshe hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer\nindeed:—\n“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair .”\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”\n[later editions continued as follows\nWhen the sands are all dry , he is gay as a lark,\nA",

It’s by far the most confusing thing I\never heard!”\n“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was\nonly too glad to do so.\n“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon went\non. “Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”\n“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock  Turtle would be so kind,” Alice replied,\nso eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, “Hm! No\naccounting for tastes! Sing her ‘ Turtle Soup ,’ will you, old fellow?”\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply , and began, in a voice sometimes choked\nwith sobs, to sing this:—\n“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\nWaiting in a hot tureen!\nWho for such dainties would not stoop?\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\nSoo—oop of ",

In the very middle of the court was a table, with a\nlarge dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite\nhungry to look at them—“I wish they’d get the trial done,” she thought,\n“and hand round the refreshments!” But there seemed to be no chance of\nthis, so she began looking at everything ",
    "ade Alice quite\nhungry to look at them—“I wish they’d get the trial done,” she thought,\n“and hand round the refreshments!” But there seemed to be no chance of\nthis, so she began looking at everything about her , to pass away the time.\nAlice had never been in a court  of justice before, but she had read about\nthem in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of\nnearly everythin g there. “That’ s the judge,” she said to herself, “because of\nhis great wig.”\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not\nlook at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\n“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”\n(she was oblige d to say “creatu res,” you see, because some of them were\nanimals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She said this\nlast word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she\nthought",
    "you see, because some of them were\nanimals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She said this\nlast word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she\nthought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the\nmeaning of it at all. However , “jury-men” would have done just as well.\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are they\ndoing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything to putdown yet, before the trial’ s begun.”\n“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply ,\n“for fear they should for get them before the end of the trial.”\n“Stupid things!”  Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped\nhastily , for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the court!” and the King\nput on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was\ntalking.\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoul ders, that\nall the jurors were writing down “st",
    "the King\nput on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was\ntalking.\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoul ders, that\nall the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates, and she\ncould even make out that one of them didn’ t know how to spell “stupid,”\nand that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice muddle their\nslates’ll be in before the trial’ s over!” thought Alice.\nOne of the juror s had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could\nnot stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon\nfound an opportunity of taking it away . She did it so quickly that the poor\nlittle juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had\nbecome of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with\none finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no\nmark on the slate.\n“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.\nOn this the White Rabbit blew th",
    "liged to write with\none finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no\nmark on the slate.\n“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.\nOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\nunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—\n“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\n    All on a summer day:\nThe Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\n    And took them quite away!”\n“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury .\n“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’ s a great deal to\ncome before that!”\n“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three\nblasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”\nThe first witness was the Hatter . He came in with a teacup in one hand\nand a piece of bread-and-butter in the other . “I beg pardon, your Majesty ,”\nhe began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’ t quite finished my tea when I\nwas sent for .”“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “Wh",

I’m a hatter .”\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter ,\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.\n“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll have\nyou executed on the spot.”\nThis did not seem to encourage  the witness at all: he kept shifting from\none foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he\nbit a lar ge piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter .\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her\na good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow\nlarger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court;\nbut on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as\nthere was room for her .\n“I wish you wouldn’ t squeeze so,” said the Dormouse, who was sitting\nnext to her . “I can hardly breathe.”\n“I can’ t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “",
    "re she was as long as\nthere was room for her .\n“I wish you wouldn’ t squeeze so,” said the Dormouse, who was sitting\nnext to her . “I can hardly breathe.”\n“I can’ t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”\n“You’ve no right to grow her e,” said the Dormouse.\n“Don’ t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re\ngrowing too.”“Yes, but I grow at a reaso nable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in that\nridiculous fashio n.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the\nother side of the court.\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter , and, just\nas the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the\ncourt, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!” on which the\nwretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes of f.\n“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily , “or I’ll have you\nexecuted, whether you’re nervous or not.”\n“I’m a poor man, your Majesty ,” the Hatter began, in a trembli ng voice,\n“—and I ha",

Go on!”\n“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after\nthat—only the March Hare said—”\n“I didn’ t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry .\n“You did!” said the Hatter .\n“I deny it!” said the March Hare.\n“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”\n“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking\nanxiously round  to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\nnothing, being fast asleep.\n“After that,” continued the Hatter , “",
    "at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking\nanxiously round  to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\nnothing, being fast asleep.\n“After that,” continued the Hatter , “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”\n“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.\n“That I can’ t remember ,” said the Hatter .\n“You must  remember ,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter , and went\ndown on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty ,” he began.\n“You’re a very poor speaker ,” said the King.Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to\nyou how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the\nmouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and\nthen sat upon it.)\n“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in the\nnewspapers, at the end ",
    "p at the\nmouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and\nthen sat upon it.)\n“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in the\nnewspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at applause,\nwhich was imme diately suppres sed by the officers of the court,” and I never\nunderstood what it meant till now .”\n“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the\nKing.\n“I can’ t go no lower ,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor , as it is.”\n“Then you may sit down,” the King replied.\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\n“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get\non better .”\n“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter , with an anxious look at the\nQueen, who was reading the list of singers.\n“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.\n“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the\noffice",

She carried the pepper -box in\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court,\nby the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\n“Give your evidence,” said the King.\n“Shan’ t,” said the cook.\nThe King looked  anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\n“Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness.”\n“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after\nfolding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of\nsight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”“Pepper , mostly ,” said the cook.\n“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her ",

Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off\nwith his whiskers!”\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the\nDormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the\ncook had disappeared.\n“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the next\nwitness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really , my dear, you\nmust cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!”\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very\ncurious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they haven’ t got\nmuch evidence yet,” she said to herself.

Imagine her surprise, when the\nWhite Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name “Alice!”CHAPTER XII.\nAlice’s Evidence\n“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a\nhurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting\nall the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below , and there they lay\nsprawling about , reminding her very much of a globe of goldf ish she had\naccidentally upset the week before.\n“Oh, I beg your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay , and\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the\ngoldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they\nmust be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.\n“The trial cannot proceed,” said ",
    "dent of the\ngoldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they\nmust be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.\n“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice,  “until all\nthe jurymen are back in their proper places— all,” he repeated with great\nemphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.\nAlice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the\nLizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail\nabout in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out\nagain, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she said to herself; “I\nshould think it would be quite  as much use in the trial one way up as the\nother .”\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset,\nand their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they\nset to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except\nthe Lizard, who seemed t",
    " shock of being upset,\nand their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they\nset to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except\nthe Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its\nmouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.\n“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.“Nothing,” said Alice.\n“Nothing whatever? ” persisted the King.\n“Nothing whatever ,” said Alice.\n“That’ s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were just\nbeginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit\ninterrupted: “Unimportant, your Majesty means , of course,” he said in a\nvery respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.\n“Unimportant, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on to\nhimself in an undertone,\n“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were\ntrying which word sounded best.\nSome of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimpo",
    " said, and went on to\nhimself in an undertone,\n“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were\ntrying which word sounded best.\nSome of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”\nAlice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; “but it\ndoesn’ t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\nhis note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule\nForty-two. All persons mor e than a mile high to leave the court .”\nEverybody looked at Alice.\n“I’m not a mile high,” said Alice.\n“You are,” said the King.\n“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.\n“Well, I shan’ t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a regular\nrule: you invented it just now .”\n“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.\n“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily . “Consider your\nverdict,” he said to the jury , in a low , tr",
    "dest rule in the book,” said the King.\n“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily . “Consider your\nverdict,” he said to the jury , in a low , trembling voice.\n“There’ s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty ,” said the\nWhite Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been picked\nup.”\n“What’ s in it?” said the Queen.\n“I haven’ t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a\nletter , written by the prisoner to—to somebody .”“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to nobody ,\nwhich isn’ t usual, you know .”\n“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.\n“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’ s nothing\nwritten on the outside .” He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added “It\nisn’t a letter , after all: it’ s a set of verses.”\n“Are they in the prisoner ’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.\n“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “",
    "aper as he spoke, and added “It\nisn’t a letter , after all: it’ s a set of verses.”\n“Are they in the prisoner ’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.\n“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest thing\nabout it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)\n“He must have imitated somebo dy else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury\nall brightened up again.)\n“Please your Majesty ,” said the Knave, “I didn’ t write it, and they can’t\nprove I did: there’ s no name signed at the end.”\n“If you didn’ t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter worse.\nYou must  have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed your name\nlike an honest man.”\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever\nthing the King had said that day .\n“That proves his guilt,” said the Queen.\n“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why , you don’t even know\nwhat they’re about!”\n“Read them,” said the King.\nThe White Rabb it put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begi",

I don’ t believe there’ s an atom of meaning in it.”\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, “She doesn’ t believe  there’ s an\natom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the paper .\n“If there’ s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of\ntrouble, you know , as we needn ’t try to find any.

And yet I don’t know ,” he\nwent on, spreading out the verse s on his knee, and looking at them with one\neye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. “—said I could not\nswim —” you can’ t swim, can you?” he added, turning to the Knave.\nThe Knave shoo k his head sadly . “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he\ncertainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.)\n“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the\nverses to himsel f: “‘We know  it to be true—’ that’s the jury, of course—‘ I\ngave her one, they gave him two—’ why, that must be what he did with the\ntarts, you know—”\n“But, it goes on ‘ they all r eturned fr om him to you ,’” said Alice.“Why , there they are!” said the King triumphantly , pointing to the tarts on\nthe table. “Nothing can be clearer than that.

Then again—‘ befor e she had\nthis fit —’ you never had fits, my dear , I think?” he said to the Queen.\n“Never!” said the Queen furious ly, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as\nshe spok e. (The  unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with\none finger , as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again,\nusing the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)\n“Then the word s don’t fit you,” said the King, looking round the court\nwith a smile. There was a dead silence.\n“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,\n“Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for about the twentieth\ntime that day .\n“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”\n“Stuf f and nonse nse!” said Alice loudly . “The idea of having the sentence\nfirst!”\n“H",

Nobody\nmoved.\n“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this\ntime.) “Y ou’re nothing but a pack of cards!”\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger , and tried to\nbeat them off, and found herself  lying on the bank, with her head in the lap\nof her sister , who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had\nfluttered down from the trees upon her face.\n“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why , what a long sleep you’ve\nhad!”\n“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her sister ,\nas well as she could remember t",

About three years ago, Mr. Gulliver growing weary of the concourse\nof curious people coming to him at his house in Redrif f, made a small\npurchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark, in\nNottinghamshire, his native coun try; where he now lives retired,  yet in go",

I have\ncarefully peruse d them three times. The style is very plain and simple; and\nthe only fault I find is, that the author , after the manner of travellers, is a\nlittle too circumstantial.

    "a\nlittle too circumstantial. There is an air of truth apparent through the whole;\nand indeed the author was so distinguished for his veracity , that it became a\nsort of proverb among his neighbours at Redrif f, when any one affirmed a\nthing, to say , it was as true as if Mr . Gulliver had spoken it.\nBy the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the author ’s\npermission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to send them into\nthe world, hoping they may be, at least for some time, a better\nentertainment to our young noblemen, than the common scribbles of\npolitics and party .\nThis volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not made\nbold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and tides, as\nwell as to the variations and bearings in the several voyages, together with\nthe minute descriptions of the management of the ship in storms, in thestyle of sailors; likewise the account of longitudes and latitude s; wherein I\nhave reason to apprehend, that M",

But\nI was resolved to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of\nreaders. However , if my own ignorance in sea affairs shall have led me to\ncommit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them. And if any\ntraveller hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came from the\nhands of the author , I will be ready to gratify him.\nAs for any further particulars relating to the author , the reader will\nreceive satisfaction from the first pages of the book.\nRICHARD SYMPSON.A LETTER FROM CAPTAIN GULLIVER TO HIS\nCOUSIN SYMPSON.\nWRITTEN  IN  THE  Y EAR 1727.\nI hope you will be ready to own publicly , whenever you shall be called to\nit, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on me to publish a\nvery loose and uncorrect",
    "N  IN  THE  Y EAR 1727.\nI hope you will be ready to own publicly , whenever you shall be called to\nit, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on me to publish a\nvery loose and uncorrect account of my travels, with directions to hire some\nyoung gentleman of either university to put them in order , and correct the\nstyle, as my cousin Dampier did, by my advice, in his book called “A\nVoyage round the world.” But I do not remember I gave you power to\nconsent that any thing should be omitted, and much less that any thing\nshould be inserted; therefore, as to the latter , I do here renounce  every thing\nof that kind; particularly a paragraph about her majesty Queen Anne, of\nmost pious and glorious memor y; although I did reverence and esteem her\nmore than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator , ought to\nhave considered, that it was not my inclination, so was it not decent to\npraise any animal of our compo sition before my master Houyhnhnm : And\nbesides, the fact wa",
    "ou, or your interpolator , ought to\nhave considered, that it was not my inclination, so was it not decent to\npraise any animal of our compo sition before my master Houyhnhnm : And\nbesides, the fact was altogether false; for to my knowledg e, being in\nEngland during some part of her majesty’ s reign, she did govern by a chief\nminister; nay even by two successively , the first whereof was the lord of\nGodolphin, and the second the lord of Oxford; so that you have made me\nsay the thing that was not. Likewise in the account of the academy of\nprojectors, and several passages  of my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm ,\nyou have either omitted some material circumstances, or minced  or changed\nthem in such a manner , that I do hardly know my own work.

    "in a letter , you were pleased to\nanswer that you were afraid of giving offence; that people in power were\nvery watchful over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish\nevery thing which looked like an innuendo  (as I think you call it). But, pray\nhow could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about five thousand\nleagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of the Y ahoos , who\nnow are said to govern the herd; especially at a time when I little thought,or feared, the unhappiness of living under them? Have not I the most reason\nto complain, when I see these very Y ahoos  carried by Houyhnhnms  in a\nvehicle, as if they were brutes, and those the rational creatures? And indeed\nto avoid  so monstrous and detestable a sight was one principal motive of\nmy retirement hither .\nThus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself, and to the\ntrust I reposed in you.\nI do, in the next place, complain of my own great want of judgment, in\nbeing prevailed upon",
    " hither .\nThus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself, and to the\ntrust I reposed in you.\nI do, in the next place, complain of my own great want of judgment, in\nbeing prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasoning of you and some\nothers, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my travels to be\npublished. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired you to consider ,\nwhen you insist ed on the motive of public good, that the Y ahoos  were a\nspecies of animals utterly incap able of amendment by precept or example:\nand so it has proved; for, instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and\ncorruptions, at least in this little island, as I had reason to expect; behold,\nafter above six months warning , I cannot learn that my book has produced\none single effect according to my intentions.

    "rding to my intentions. I desired you would let me\nknow , by a letter , when party and faction were extinguished; judges learned\nand upright; pleaders honest and modest, with some tincture of common\nsense, and Smithfield blazing with pyramids of law books; the young\nnobility’ s education entirely changed; the physicians banished; the female\nY ahoos  abounding in virtue, honour , truth, and good sense; courts and\nlevees of great ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit, and\nlearning rewarded; all disgracers  of the press in prose and verse  condemned\nto eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with their own\nink. These, and a thousand other reformations, I firmly count ed upon by\nyour encouragement; as indeed they were plainly deducibl e from the\nprecepts deliver ed in my book.

    "d in my book.  And it must be owned, that seven months\nwere a sufficient time to correc t every vice and folly to which Y ahoos  are\nsubject, if their natures had been capable of the least disposition  to virtue or\nwisdom. Yet, so far have you been from answering my expectation in any of\nyour letters; that on the contra ry you are loading our carrier every week\nwith libels, and keys, and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts;\nwherein I see myself accused of reflecting upon great state folk; of\ndegrading human nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it),\nand of abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those\nbundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not allowme to be the author of my own travels; and others make me author of books\nto which I am wholly a stranger .\nI find likewise that your printer has been so careless as to confound the\ntimes, and mistake the dates, of my several voyages and returns; neither\nassigning the true y",
    "o which I am wholly a stranger .\nI find likewise that your printer has been so careless as to confound the\ntimes, and mistake the dates, of my several voyages and returns; neither\nassigning the true year, nor the true month, nor day of the month: and I hear\nthe origi nal manuscript is all destroyed since the publication of my book;\nneither have I any copy left: however , I have sent you some corrections,\nwhich you may insert, if ever there should be a second edition: and yet I\ncannot stand to them; but shall leave that matter to my judicious  and candid\nreaders to adjust it as they please.\nI hear some of our sea Y ahoos  find fault with my sea-language, as not\nproper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my first voyages,\nwhile I was young, I was instructed by the oldest mariners, and learned to\nspeak as they did. But I have since found that the sea Y ahoos  are apt, like\nthe land ones, to become new-fangled in their words, which the latter\nchange every year; insomuch, as",

But I have since found that the sea Y ahoos  are apt, like\nthe land ones, to become new-fangled in their words, which the latter\nchange every year; insomuch, as I remember upon each return  to my own\ncountry their old dialect was so altered, that I could hardly understand the\nnew. And I observe, when any Y ahoo  comes from London out of curio sity to\nvisit me at my house, we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in\na manner intelligible to the other .\nIf the censure of the Y ahoos  could any way affect me, I shou ld have great\nreason to complain, that some of them are so bold as to think my book of\ntravels a mere fiction out of mine own brain, and have gone so far as to\ndrop hints, that the Houyhnhnms  and Y ahoos  have no more existence than\nthe inhabitants of Utopia.\nIndeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput , Br obdingrag  (for\nso the word should have been spelt, and not erroneously Br obdingnag ), and\nLaputa , I hav",

And is there less\nprobability in my account of the Houyhnhnms  or Y ahoos , when it is\nmanifest as to the latter , there are so many thousands even in this country ,\nwho only differ from their broth er brutes in Houyhnhnmland , becaus e they\nuse a sort of jabber , and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and\nnot their approbation. The unite d praise of the whole race would be of less\nconsequence to me, than the neighing of those two degenerate HouyhnhnmsI keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they are, I still\nimprove in some virtues without any mixture of vice.\nDo these miserab",

Y ahoo  as I am, it is well known through all\nHouyhnhnmland , that, by the instructions and example of my illustrious\nmaster , I was able in the compa ss of two years (although I confess with the\nutmost difficulty) to remove that infernal habit of lying, shuffling,\ndeceiving, and equivocating, so deeply rooted in the very souls of all my\nspecies; especially the Europeans.\nI have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasi on; but I\nforbear troubling myself or you any further .

My\nfather now and then sending me small sums of money , I laid them out in\nlearning navigation, and other parts of the mathematics, useful to those who\nintend to travel, as I always believed it would be, some time or other , my\nfortune to do. When I left Mr. Bates, I went down to my father: where, by\nthe assistance of him and my uncle John, and some other relations, I got\nforty pounds, and a promise of thirty pounds a year to maintain me at\nLeyden: there I studied physic two years and seven months, knowing it\nwould be useful in long voyages.\nSoon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended by my good\nmaster , Mr. Bates, to be surgeon to the Swallow , Captain Abraham Pannel,\ncommander; with whom I continued th",

When I came back I\nresolved to settle in London; to which Mr. Bates, my master , encouraged\nme, and by him I was recomm ended to several patients. I took part of a\nsmall house in the Old Jewry; and being advised to alter my condition, I\nmarried Mrs. Mary Burton, second daughter to Mr. Edmund Burton, hosier ,\nin Newgate-street, with whom I received four hundred pounds for a portion.\nBut my good master Bates dying in two years after, and I having few\nfriends, my business began to fail; for my conscience would not suffer me\nto imita te the bad practice of too many among my brethren.

I was surgeon successively in two ships, and\nmade several voyages, for six years, to the East and West Indies, by which I\ngot some addition to my fortune . My hours of leisure I spent in reading the\nbest authors, ancient and modern, being always provided with a good\nnumber of books; and when I was ashore, in observing the manners and\ndispositions of the people, as well as learning their language; wherein I had\na great facility , by the strength of my memory .\nThe last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew weary of the\nsea, and intended to stay at home with my wife and family . I removed from\nthe Old Jewry to Fetter Lane, and from thence to Wapping, hoping to get\nbusiness among  the sailors; but it would not turn to account.

After three\nyears expectation that things would mend, I accepted an advantageous offer\nfrom Captain William Prichard, master of the Antelope, who was making a\nvoyage to the South Sea. We set sail from Bristol, May 4, 1699, and our\nvoyage was at first very prosperous.\nIt would not be proper , for some reasons, to trouble the reader  with the\nparticulars of our adventures in those seas; let it suffice to infor m him, that\nin our passage from thence to the East Indies, we were driven by a violent\nstorm to the north-west of Van Diemen’ s Land. By an observation, we\nfound ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes south. Twelve of our\ncrew were dead by immoderate labour and ill food; the rest were in a very\nweak condition.

    "r and ill food; the rest were in a very\nweak condition.  On the 5th of November , which was the beginning of\nsummer in those parts, the weather being very hazy, the seamen spied a\nrock within half a cable’ s length of the ship; but the wind was so strong,\nthat we were driven directly upon it, and immediately split. Six of the crew ,\nof whom I was one, having let down the boat into the sea, made a shift to\nget clear of the ship and the rock. We rowed, by my comput ation, about\nthree leagues, till we were able to work no longer , being already  spent with\nlabour while we were in the ship. We therefore trusted ourse lves to the\nmercy of the waves, and in about half an hour the boat was overset by a\nsudden flurry from the north. What became of my companions in the boat,\nas well as of those who escaped on the rock, or were left in the vessel, I\ncannot tell; but conclude they were all lost.

I often let\nmy legs drop, and could feel no bottom; but when I was almost gone, and\nable to struggle no longer , I found myself within my depth; and by this timethe storm was much abated. The declivity was so small, that I walked near a\nmile before I got to the shore, which I conjectured was about eight o’clock\nin the evening. I then advanced forward near half a mile, but could not\ndiscover any sign of houses or inhabitants; at least I was in so weak a\ncondition, that I did not observe  them. I was extremely tired, and with that,\nand the heat of the weather , and about half a pint of brandy that I drank as I\nleft the ship, I found myself much inclined to sleep.

    " I\nleft the ship, I found myself much inclined to sleep. I lay down on the grass,\nwhich was very short and soft, where I slept sounder than ever I\nremembered to have done in my life, and, as I reckoned, about nine hours;\nfor when I awaked, it was just day-light. I attempted to rise, but was not\nable to stir: for, as I happened to lie on my back, I found my arms and legs\nwere strongly fastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was\nlong and thick, tied down in the same manner . I likewise felt several slender\nligatures across my body , from my arm-pits to my thighs. I could only look\nupwards; the sun began to grow hot, and the light offended my eyes. I heard\na confus ed noise  about me; but in the posture I lay, could see nothing except\nthe sky.

In the mean time, I felt at least forty more of the\nsame kind (as I conjectured) following the first. I was in the utmost\nastonishment, and roared so loud, that they all ran back in a fright; and\nsome of them, as I was afterwards told, were hurt with the falls they got by\nleaping from my sides upon the ground. However , they soon returned, and\none of them, who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face, lifting up\nhis hand s and eyes by way of admiration, cried out in a shrill  but distinct\nvoice, Hekinah degul : the others repeated the same words several times, but\nthen I knew not what they meant.

At length, struggling to get loose , I had the\nfortune to break the strings, and wrench out the pegs that fastened my left\narm to the ground; for, by lifting it up to my face, I discovered the methods\nthey had taken to bind me, and at the same time with a violent pull, which\ngave me excessi ve pain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair\non the left side, so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches.\nBut the creatures ran off a second time, before I could seize them;\nwhereupon there  was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and after it ceasedI heard one of them cry aloud Tolgo phonac ; when in an instant I felt above\na hundre d arrow s dischar ged on my left hand, which, pricked  me like so\nmany needles; and besides, they shot another flight into the air, as we do\nbombs in Europ e, whereof many ",

When this shower of arrows was over, I fell a groaning with grief and\npain; and then striving again to get loose, they dischar ged another volley\nlarger than the first, and some of them attempted with spears to stick me in\nthe sides; but by good luck I had on a buff jerkin, which they could not\npierce. I thought it the most prudent method to lie still, and my design was\nto contin ue so till night, when,  my left hand being already loose, I could\neasily free myse lf: and as for the inhabitants, I had reason to believe I might\nbe a match for the greatest army they could bring against me, if they were\nall of the same size with him that I saw.

    "as for the inhabitants, I had reason to believe I might\nbe a match for the greatest army they could bring against me, if they were\nall of the same size with him that I saw. But fortune disposed otherwise of\nme. When the people observed I was quiet, they dischar ged no more\narrows; but, by the noise I heard , I knew their numbers increased; and about\nfour yards from me, over agains t my right ear, I heard a knockin g for above\nan hour, like that of people at work; when turning my head that way, as well\nas the pegs and strings would permit me, I saw a stage erected about a foot\nand a half from the ground, capable of holding four of the inhab itants, with\ntwo or three ladders to mount it: from whence one of them, who seemed to\nbe a person of quality , made me a long speech, whereof I understood not\none syllable.

He acted every part of an orator , and I\ncould observe many periods of threatenings, and others of promises, pity,\nand kindness.

The hurgo (for so they call a\ngreat lord, as I afterwards learn t) understood me very well. He descended\nfrom the stage, and commande d that several ladders should be applied to\nmy sides, on which above a hundred of the inhabitants mounted and walked\ntowards my mouth, laden with baskets full of meat, which had been\nprovided and sent thither by the king’ s orders, upon the first intelligence he\nreceived of me.

I observed there was the flesh of several animals, but could\nnot distinguish them by the taste. There were shoulders, legs, and loins,\nshaped like those of mutton, and very well dressed, but smal ler than the\nwings of a lark. I ate them by two or three at a mouthful, and took three\nloaves at a time, about the bigness of musket bullets. They supplied me as\nfast as they could, showing a thousand marks of wonder and astonishment\nat my bulk and appetite. I then made another sign, that I wanted drink. They\nfound by my eating that a small quantity would not suffice me; and being a\nmost ingenious people, they slung up, with great dexterity , one of their\nlargest hogsheads, then rolled it towards my hand, and beat out the top; I\ndrank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not hold half a\npint, and tasted like a small wine of Burgundy , but much more deli",
    "then rolled it towards my hand, and beat out the top; I\ndrank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not hold half a\npint, and tasted like a small wine of Burgundy , but much more delicious.\nThey brought me a second hogshead, which I drank in the same manner ,\nand made signs for more; but they had none to give me. When I had\nperformed these wonders, they shouted for joy, and danced upon  my breast,\nrepeating several times as they did at first, Hekinah degul . They made me a\nsign that I should throw down the two hogsheads, but first warning the\npeople below to stand out of the way, crying aloud, Borach mevolah ; and\nwhen they saw the vessels in the air, there was a universal shout of Hekinah\ndegul . I confe ss I was often tempted, while they were passing back wards\nand forwards on my body , to seize forty or fifty of the first that came in my\nreach, and dash them against the ground.

But the remembrance of what I\nhad felt, which probably migh t not be the worst they could do, and the\npromise of honour I made them—for so I interpreted my submissive\nbehaviour—soon drove out these imaginations. Besides, I now considered\nmyself as bound by the laws of hospitality , to a people who had treated me\nwith so much expense and magnificence. However , in my thoughts I could\nnot sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these diminutive mortals, who\ndurst venture to mount and walk  upon my body , while one of my hands wasat liberty , without trembling at the very sight of so prodigious a creature as I\nmust appear to them. After some time, when they observed that I made no\nmore demands for meat, there appeared before me a person of high rank\nfrom his imperia l majesty .

His excellency , having mounted on the small of\nmy right leg, advanced forward s up to my face, with about a dozen of his\nretinue; and producing his credentials under the signet royal, which he\napplied close to my eyes, spoke about ten minutes without any signs of\nanger , but with a kind of deter minate resolution, often pointin g forwards,\nwhich, as I afterwards found, was towards the capital city, about half a mile\ndistant; whither it was agreed by his majesty in council that I must be\nconveyed. I answered in few words, but to no purpose, and made a sign\nwith my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but over his\nexcellency’ s head for fear of hurting him or his train) and then to my own\nhead and body , to signify that I desired my liberty .

However , he made other signs to let me understand that I\nshould have meat and drink enough, and very good treatment. Whereupon I\nonce more thought of attempting to break my bonds; but again, when I felt\nthe smart of their arrows upon my face and hands, which were all in\nblisters, and many of the darts still sticking in them, and observing likewise\nthat the number of my enemies increased, I gave tokens to let them know\nthat they might do with me what they pleased. Upon this, the hurgo and his\ntrain withdrew , with much civility and cheerful countenances.

    "fter I\nheard a general shout, with frequent repetitions of the words Peplom selan ;\nand I felt great numbers of people on my left side relaxing the cords to such\na degree , that I was able to turn upon my right, and to ease myself with\nmaking water; which I very plentifully did, to the great astonishment of the\npeople; who, conjecturing by my motion what I was going to do,\nimmediately opened to the right and left on that side, to avoid the torrent,\nwhich fell with such noise and violence from me. But before this, they had\ndaubed my face and both my hands with a sort of ointment, very pleasant to\nthe smel l, which , in a few minutes, removed all the smart of their arrows.\nThese circumstances, added to the refreshment I had received by their\nvictuals and drink, which were  very nourishing, disposed me to sleep. I\nslept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and it was no wonder ,for the physicians, by the emperor ’s order , had mingled a sleepy potion in\nthe hogsheads of wine.\nI",

I\nslept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and it was no wonder ,for the physicians, by the emperor ’s order , had mingled a sleepy potion in\nthe hogsheads of wine.\nIt seems , that upon the first moment I was discovered sleeping on the\nground, after my landing, the emperor had early notice of it by an express;\nand determined in council, that I should be tied in the manner I have\nrelated, (which was done in the night while I slept;) that plenty of meat and\ndrink should be sent to me, and a machine prepared to carry  me to the\ncapital city .\nThis resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous, and I am\nconfident would  not be imitat ed by any prince in Europe on the like\noccasion. Howe ver, in my opinion, it was extremely prudent, as well as\ngenerous: for, supposing these people had endeavoured to kill me with their\nspears and arrow s, while I was asleep, I should certainly have awaked with\nthe first sense of smart, which  might so far have roused",
    " for, supposing these people had endeavoured to kill me with their\nspears and arrow s, while I was asleep, I should certainly have awaked with\nthe first sense of smart, which  might so far have roused my rage and\nstrength, as to have enabled me to break the strings wherewith  I was tied;\nafter which, as they were not able to make resistance, so they could expect\nno mercy .\nThese people are most excellent mathematicians, and arrived to a great\nperfection in mechanics, by the countenance and encouragem ent of the\nemperor , who is a renowned patron of learning. This prince has several\nmachines fixed on wheels, for the carriage of trees and other great weights.\nHe often builds his largest men of war, whereof some are nine feet long, in\nthe woods where the timber grows, and has them carried on these engines\nthree or four hundred yards to the sea.

It was a frame of wood raised three inches from the ground, about\nseven feet long, and four wide, moving upon twenty-two wheels. The shout\nI heard was upon the arrival of this engine, which, it seems, set out in four\nhours after my landing. It was brought parallel to me, as I lay. But the\nprincipal difficulty was to raise and place me in this vehicle. Eighty poles,\neach of one foot high, were erected for this purpose, and very strong cords,\nof the bigness of packthread, were fastened by hooks to many bandages,\nwhich the workmen had girt round my neck, my hands, my body, and my\nlegs. Nine hundred of the strongest men were employed to draw up these\ncords, by many pulleys fastene d on the poles; and thus, in less than three\nhours, I was raised and slung into the engine, and there tied fast.

Fifteen\nhundred of the emperor ’s largest horses, each about four inche s and a half\nhigh, were empl oyed to draw me towards the metropolis, which, as I said,\nwas half a mile distant.\nAbout four hours after we began our journey , I awaked by a very\nridiculous accident; for the carriage being stopped a while, to adjust\nsomething that was out of order , two or three of the young natives had the\ncuriosity to see how I looked when I was asleep; they climbed  up into the\nengine, and advancing very softly to my face, one of them, an officer in the\nguards, put the sharp end of his half-pike a good way up into my left nostril,\nwhich tickled my nose like a straw , and made me sneez e",
    "advancing very softly to my face, one of them, an officer in the\nguards, put the sharp end of his half-pike a good way up into my left nostril,\nwhich tickled my nose like a straw , and made me sneez e violently;\nwhereupon they stole off unperceived, and it was three weeks before I knew\nthe cause of my waking so suddenly . We made a long march the remaining\npart of the day, and, rested at night with five hundred guards on each side of\nme, half with torches, and half with bows and arrows, ready to shoot me if I\nshould offer to stir. The next morning at sunrise we continued our march,\nand arrived within two hundred yards of the city gates about noon. The\nemperor , and all his court, came  out to meet us; but his great officers would\nby no means suffer his majesty to endanger his person by mounting on my\nbody .\nAt the place where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple,\nesteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom; which, having been\npolluted some years before by an unnatural",

In\nthis edifice it was determined I should lodge. The great gate fronting to the\nnorth was about  four feet high, and almost two feet wide, through which I\ncould easily creep. On each side of the gate was a small window , not above\nsix inches from the ground: into that on the left side, the king’s smith\nconveyed foursc ore and eleven chains, like those that hang to a lady’s watch\nin Europ e, and almost as large, which were locked to my left leg with six-\nand-thirty padlocks.

It was\nreckoned that above a hundred thousand inhabitants came out of the townupon the same errand; and, in spite of my guards, I believe there could not\nbe fewer than ten thousand at several times, who mounted my body by the\nhelp of ladders. But a proclama tion was soon issued, to forbid it upon pain\nof death . When the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose,\nthey cut all the strings that bound me; whereupon I rose up, with as\nmelancholy a disposition as ever I had in my life.

These fields were\nintermingled with woods of half a stang,[301] and the tallest trees, as I could\njudge, appeared to be seven feet high. I viewed the town on my left hand,\nwhich looked like the painted scene of a city in a theatre.\nI had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of nature;\nwhich was no wonder , it being almost two days since I had last disburdened\nmyself. I was under great difficulties between urgency and shame. The best\nexpedient I could think of, was to creep into my house, which I accordingly\ndid; and shutting the gate after me, I went as far as the length of my chain\nwould suffer, and dischar ged my body of that uneasy load.

But this was the\nonly time I was ever guilty of so uncleanly an action; for which I cannot but\nhope the candid reader will give some allowance, after he has maturely and\nimpartially considered my case, and the distress I was in. From this time my\nconstant practice was, as soon as I rose, to perform that business in open air,\nat the full extent of my chain; and due care was taken every morning before\ncompany came,  that the offensive matter should be carried off in wheel-\nbarrows, by two servants appoin ted for that purpose. I would not have dwelt\nso long upon a circumstance that, perhaps, at first sight, may appear not\nvery momentous, if I had not thought it necessary to justify my character , in\npoint of cleanliness, to the world; which, I am told, some of my maligners\nhave been pleased, upon this and other occasions, to call in question.When this adven ture was at an end, I came back out of my hous e, having\noccasion for fresh",
    "which, I am told, some of my maligners\nhave been pleased, upon this and other occasions, to call in question.When this adven ture was at an end, I came back out of my hous e, having\noccasion for fresh air. The empe ror was already descended from the tower ,\nand advancing on horseback towards me, which had like to have cost him\ndear; for the beast, though very well trained, yet wholly unuse d to such a\nsight, which appeared as if a mountain moved before him, reared up on its\nhinder feet: but that prince, who is an excellent horseman, kept his seat, till\nhis attendants ran in, and held the bridle, while his majesty had time to\ndismount. When  he alighted, he surveyed me round with great admiration;\nbut kept beyond the length of my chain. He ordered his cooks and butlers,\nwho were already prepared, to give me victuals and drink, which they\npushed forward in a sort of vehicles upon wheels, till I could reach them.

The empr ess, and young princes of the blood of both\nsexes, attended by many ladies, sat at some distance in their chairs; but\nupon the accident that happened  to the emperor ’s horse, they alighted, and\ncame near his person, which I am now going to describe. He is taller by\nalmost the breadth of my nail, than any of his court; which alone is enough\nto strike an awe into the beholders.

His features are strong and masculine,\nwith an Austrian lip and arched nose, his complexion olive, his countenance\nerect, his body and limbs well proportioned, all his motions graceful, and\nhis deportment majestic. He was then past his prime, being twenty-eight\nyears and three quarters old, of which he had reigned about seven in great\nfelicity , and generally victorious. For the better convenience of beholding\nhim, I lay on my side, so that my face was parallel to his, and he stood but\nthree yards off: however , I have had him since many times in my hand, and\ntherefore cannot be deceived in the description. His dress was very plain\nand simp le, and the fashion of it between the Asiatic and the European; but\nhe had on his head a light helmet of gold, adorned with jewels, and a plume\non the crest.

He held his sword drawn in his hand to defend himself, if I\nshould happen to break loose; it was almost three inches long; the hilt and\nscabbard were gold enriched with diamonds. His voice was shrill, but very\nclear and articulate; and I could distinctly hear it when I stood up. The\nladies and court iers were all most magnificently clad; so that the spot they\nstood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread upon the ground,embroidered with figures of gold and silver . His imperial majesty spoke\noften to me, and I returned answers: but neither of us could understand a\nsyllable. There were several of his priests and lawyers present (as I\nconjectured by their habits), who were commanded to address themselves to\nme; and I spoke  to them in as many languages as I had the least smattering\nof, whic h were High and Low Dutch, Latin, French, Spanish, Italian, and\nLingua Franca, but all to no purpose.

After about two hours the court\nretired, and I was left with a strong guard, to prevent the imper tinence, and\nprobably the malice of the rabble, who were very impatient to crowd about\nme as near as they durst; and some of them had the impuden ce to shoot\ntheir arrows at me, as I sat on the ground by the door of my house, whereof\none very narrowly missed my left eye. But the colonel ordere d six of the\nringleaders to be seized, and thought no punishment so proper as to deliver\nthem bound into my hands; which some of his soldiers accordingly did,\npushing them forward with the butt-ends of their pikes into my reach.

I treated the\nrest in the same manner , taking them one by one out of my pocket; and I\nobserved both the soldiers and people were highly delighted at this mark of\nmy clemency , which was represented very much to my advantage at court.\nTowards night I got with some difficulty into my house, where I lay on\nthe ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight; during which time, the\nemperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me.

He\ndirected that those who had already beheld me should return home, and not\npresume to come within fifty yards of my house, without license from the\ncourt; whereby the secretaries of state got considerable fees.\nIn the mean time the emperor held frequent councils, to debate what\ncourse should be taken with me; and I was afterwards assured by a\nparticular friend , a person of great quality , who was as much in the secret as\nany, that the court was unde r many difficulties concerning me. They\napprehended my breaking loose; that my diet would be very expensive, and\nmight cause a famine. Sometim es they determined to starve me; or at least\nto shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned arrows, which would soon\ndespatch me; but again they considered, that the stench of so large a carcass\nmight produce a plague in the metropolis, and probably spread through the\nwhole kingdom.

In the midst of these consultations, several officers of the\narmy went to the door of the great council-chamber , and two of them being\nadmitted, gave an account of my behaviour to the six crimi nals above-\nmentioned; which made so favourable an impression in the breast of his\nmajesty and the whole board, in my behalf, that an imperial commission\nwas issued out, obliging all the villages, nine hundred yards round the city,\nto deliver in every morning six beeves, forty sheep, and other victuals for\nmy sustenance; together with a proportionable quantity of bread, and wine,\nand other liquors; for the due payment of which, his majesty gave\nassignments upon his treasury:—for this prince lives chiefly upon his own\ndemesnes; seldom, except upon great occasions, raising any subsidies upon\nhis subjects, who are bound to attend him in his wars at thei",

It was likewise\nordered, that three hundred tailors should make me a suit of clothes, after\nthe fashion of the country; that six of his majesty’ s greatest scholars should\nbe employed to instruct me in their language; and lastly , that the emperor ’s\nhorses, and those of the nobility and troops of guards, should be frequently\nexercised in my sight, to accustom themselves to me.

    "orders were\nduly put in execution; and in about three weeks I made a great progress in\nlearning their language; during which time the emperor frequently honoured\nme with his visits, and was pleased to assist my masters in teaching me. Webegan already to converse together in some sort; and the first words I learnt,\nwere to express my desire “that he would please give me my liberty;” which\nI every day repeated on my knees. His answer , as I could comprehend it,\nwas, “that this must be a work of time, not to be thought on without the\nadvice of his council, and that first I must lumos kelmin pesso desmar lon\nemposo ;” that is, swear a peace with him and his kingdom. However , that I\nshould be used with all kindne ss. And he advised me to “acquire, by my\npatience and discreet behaviou r, the good opinion of himself and his\nsubjects.” He desired “I would not take it ill, if he gave orders to certain\nproper officers to search me; for probably I might carry about  me several\nweapons, which  mu",

He replied, “that, by the laws of\nthe kingdom, I must be searched by two of his officers; that he knew this\ncould not be done without my consent and assistance; and he had so good\nan opinion of my generosity and justice, as to trust their persons in my\nhands; that whatever they took from me, should be returned when I left the\ncountry , or paid for at the rate which I would set upon them.” I took up the\ntwo officers in my hands, put them first into my coat-pockets, and then into\nevery other pocket about me, except my two fobs, and another secret\npo",
    "the rate which I would set upon them.” I took up the\ntwo officers in my hands, put them first into my coat-pockets, and then into\nevery other pocket about me, except my two fobs, and another secret\npocket, which I had no mind should be searched, wherein I had some little\nnecessaries that were of no consequence to any but myself. In one of my\nfobs there was a silver watch, and in the other a small quantity of gold in a\npurse. These gentlemen, having  pen, ink, and paper , about them, made an\nexact inventory of every thing they saw; and when they had done, desired I\nwould set them down, that they might deliver it to the emperor . This\ninventory I afterwards translated into English, and is, word for word, as\nfollows:\n“Imprimis : In the right coat-pocket of the great man-mountain” (for\nso I interpret the words quinbus flestrin ,) “after the strictest search, we\nfound only one great piece of coarse-cloth, large enough to be a foot-\ncloth for your majesty’ s chief room of state.

In the left pocket we saw a\nhuge silver chest, with a cover of the same metal, which we, the\nsearchers, were not able to lift. We desired it should be opened, and\none of us stepping into it, found himself up to the mid leg in a sort ofdust, some part whereof flying up to our faces set us both a sneezing\nfor several times together . In his right waistcoat-pocket we found a\nprodigious bundle of white thin substances, folded one over another ,\nabout the bignes s of three men,  tied with a strong cable, and marked\nwith black figures; which we humbly conceive to be writings, every\nletter almost half as large as the palm of our hands.

In the large pocket, on the right\nside of his middle cover” (so I translate the word ranfulo , by which\nthey meant my breeches,) “we saw a hollow pillar of iron, about the\nlength of a man, fastened to a strong piece of timber larger than the\npillar; and upon one side of the pillar , were huge pieces of iron sticking\nout, cut into strange figures, which we know not what to make  of. In\nthe left pocket, another engine of the same kind.

    "ler pocket\non the right side, were several round flat pieces of white and red metal,\nof different bulk; some of the white, which seemed to be silver , were\nso large and heavy, that my comrade and I could hardly lift them. In\nthe left pocket were two black pillars irregularly shaped: we could not,\nwithout difficult y, reach the top of them, as we stood at the bottom of\nhis pocket. One of them was covered, and seemed all of a piece : but at\nthe upper end of the other there appeared a white round substance,\nabout twice the bigness of our heads. Within each of these was\nenclosed a prodigious plate of steel; which, by our orders, we obliged\nhim to show us, because we apprehended they might be dangerous\nengines. He took them out of their cases, and told us, that in his own\ncountry his practice was to shave his beard with one of these, and cut\nhis meat with the other .

    "as to shave his beard with one of these, and cut\nhis meat with the other . There were two pockets which we could not\nenter: these he called his fobs; they were two large slits cut into the top\nof his middle cover , but squeezed close by the pressure of his belly .\nOut of the right fob hung a great silver chain, with a wonderful kind of\nengine at the bottom. We directed him to draw out whatever was at the\nend of that chain ; which appeared to be a globe, half silver , and half of\nsome transparen t metal; for, on the transparent side, we saw certain\nstrange figures circularly drawn , and thought we could touch them, tillwe found our fingers stopped by the lucid substance. He put this\nengine into our ears, which made an incessant noise, like that of a\nwater -mill: and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal, or the\ngod that he worships; but we are more inclined to the latter opinion,\nbecause he assured us, (if we understood him right, for he expressed\nhimself very imperfectly) that",

He called it his oracle, and said, it pointed out the time\nfor every action of his life. From  the left fob he took out a net almost\nlarge enough for a fisherman, but contrived to open and shut like a\npurse, and served him for the same use: we found therein several\nmassy pieces of yellow metal, which, if they be real gold, must be of\nimmense value.\n“Having thus, in obedience to your majesty’ s commands, diligently\nsearched all his pockets, we observed a girdle about his waist made of\nthe hide of some  prodigious animal, from which, on the left side, hung\na sword of the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or pouch\ndivided into two cells, each cell capable of holding three of your\nmajesty’ s subjec ts.

In one of these cells were several globes, or balls,\nof a most ponderous metal, about the bigness of our heads, and\nrequiring a strong hand to lift them: the other cell contained a heap of\ncertain black grains, but of no great bulk or weight, for we could hold\nabove fifty of them in the palms of our hands.\n“This is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the\nman-mountain, who used us with great civility , and due respect to your\nmajesty’ s commission. Signed and sealed on the fourth day of the\neighty-ninth moon of your majesty’ s auspicious reign.\nCLEFRIN  F RELOCK , MARSI  F RELOCK .”\nWhen this inventory was read over to the emperor , he directed me,\nalthough in very gentle terms, to deliver up the several particulars.

In the mean time\nhe ordered three thousand of his choicest troops (who then attended him) to\nsurround me at a distance, with their bows and arrows just ready to\ndischar ge; but I did not observe it, for my eyes were wholly fixed upon his\nmajesty . He then desired me to draw my scimitar , which, although it had got\nsome rust by the sea water , was, in most parts, exceeding bright. I did so,\nand immediately all the troops gave a shout between terror and surprise; forthe sun shone clear, and the reflection dazzled their eyes, as I waved the\nscimitar to and fro in my hand.  His majesty , who is a most magnanimous\nprince, was less daunted than I could expect: he ordered me to return it into\nthe scabbard, and cast it on the ground as gently as I could, about six feet\nfrom the end of my chain.

The next thing he demanded was one of the\nhollow iron pillars; by which he meant my pocket pistols. I drew it out, and\nat his desire, as well as I could, expressed to him the use of it; and charging\nit only with powder , which, by the closeness of my pouch, happened to\nescape wetting in the sea (an inconvenience against which all prudent\nmariners take special care to provide,) I first cautioned the emperor not to\nbe afraid, and then I let it off in the air. The astonishment here was much\ngreater than at the sight of my scimitar . Hundreds fell down as if they had\nbeen struck dead; and even the emperor , although he stood his ground,\ncould not recover himself for some time. I delivered up both my pistols in\nthe same manner as I had done my scimitar , and then my pouch  of powder\nand bullets; begging him that the",

I delivered up both my pistols in\nthe same manner as I had done my scimitar , and then my pouch  of powder\nand bullets; begging him that the former might be kept from fire, for it\nwould kindle with the smallest spark, and blow up his imperial palace into\nthe air. I likewise delivered up my watch, which the emperor was very\ncurious to see, and commanded  two of his tallest yeomen of the guards to\nbear it on a pole upon their shou lders, as draymen in England do a barrel of\nale. He was amazed at the continual noise it made, and the motion of the\nminute-hand, which he could easily discern; for their sight is much more\nacute than ours: he asked the opinions of his learned men about it, which\nwere various and remote, as the reader may well imagine without my\nrepeating; although indeed I could not very perfectly understand them.

My scimitar , pistols, and\npouch, were conveyed in carriag es to his majesty’ s stores; but the rest of my\ngoods were returned me.\nI had as I before observed, one private pocket, which escaped their\nsearch, wherein there was a pair of spectacles (which I someti mes use for\nthe weakness of my eyes,) a pocket perspective, and some other little\nconveniences; which, being of no consequence to the emperor , I did not\nthink myself bound in honour to discover , and I apprehended they might be\nlost or spoiled if I ventured them out of my possession.CHAPTER III.\nThe author diverts the emperor , and his nobility of both\nsexes, in a very uncommon manner.

The diversions of the\ncourt of Lilliput described. The author has his liberty granted\nhim upon certain conditions.\nMy gentleness and good behaviour had gained so far on the emperor and\nhis court, and indeed upon the army and people in general, that I began to\nconceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time. I took all possible\nmethods to cultivate this favourable disposition. The natives came, by\ndegrees, to be less apprehensive  of any danger from me. I would  sometimes\nlie down, and let five or six of them dance on my hand; and at last the boys\nand girls would venture to come and play at hide-and-seek in my hair. I had\nnow made a good progress in understanding and speaking the language.

    " in understanding and speaking the language. The\nemperor had a mind one day to entertain me with several of the country\nshows, wherein they exceed all nations I have known, both for dexterity and\nmagnificence. I was diverted with none so much as that of the rope-dancers,\nperformed upon a slender white thread, extended about two feet, and twelve\ninches from the ground. Upon which I shall desire liberty , with the reader ’s\npatience, to enlar ge a little.\nThis diversion is only practised  by those persons who are candidates for\ngreat employments, and high favour at court. They are trained  in this art\nfrom their youth, and are not always of noble birth, or liberal education.\nWhen a great office is vacant, either by death or disgrace (which often\nhappens) five or six of those candidates petition the emperor to entertain his\nmajesty and the court with a dance on the rope; and whoever jumps the\nhighest, withou t falling, succeeds in the office.

Very often the chief\nministers themselves are comm anded to show their skill, and to convince\nthe emperor that they have not lost their faculty . Flimnap, the treasurer , is\nallowed to cut a caper on the straight rope, at least an inch higher than any\nother lord in the whole empire. I have seen him do the summe rset several\ntimes together , upon a trencher fixed on a rope which is no thicker than acommon packthread in England. My friend Reldresal, principal secretary\nfor priva te affairs, is, in my opinion, if I am not partial, the second after the\ntreasurer; the rest of the great of ficers are much upon a par .\nThese diversions are often attended with fatal accidents, whereof great\nnumbers are on record. I myself  have seen two or three candidates break a\nlimb. But the danger is much greater , when the ministers themselves are\ncomman",
    " attended with fatal accidents, whereof great\nnumbers are on record. I myself  have seen two or three candidates break a\nlimb. But the danger is much greater , when the ministers themselves are\ncommanded to show their dexterity; for, by contending to excel themselves\nand their fellows , they strain so far that there is hardly one of them who has\nnot received a fall, and some of them two or three. I was assured that, a year\nor two before my arrival, Flimnap would infallibly have broke his neck, if\none of the king’ s cushions, that accidentally lay on the ground, had not\nweakened the force of his fall.\nThere is likewise another diversion, which is only shown before the\nemperor and empress, and first minister , upon particular occasions. The\nemperor lays on the table three fine silken threads of six inches long; one is\nblue, the other red, and the third  green. These threads are proposed as prizes\nfor those  persons whom the emperor has a mind to distinguish by a peculiar\nmark of his favo",
    " of six inches long; one is\nblue, the other red, and the third  green. These threads are proposed as prizes\nfor those  persons whom the emperor has a mind to distinguish by a peculiar\nmark of his favour . The cerem ony is performed in his majesty’ s great\nchamber of state, where the candidates are to under go a trial of dexterity\nvery different from the former , and such as I have not observed the least\nresemblance of in any other country of the new or old world. The emperor\nholds a stick in his hands, both ends parallel to the horizon, while the\ncandidates advancing, one by one, sometimes leap over the stick,\nsometimes creep under it, backward and forward, several times, according\nas the stick is advanced or depressed. Sometimes the emperor holds one end\nof the stick, and his first minister the other; sometimes the minister has it\nentirely to himself. Whoever performs his part with most agility , and holds\nout the longest in leaping and creeping, is rewarded with the blue-coloured\nsil",
    "er the other; sometimes the minister has it\nentirely to himself. Whoever performs his part with most agility , and holds\nout the longest in leaping and creeping, is rewarded with the blue-coloured\nsilk; the red is given to the next, and the green to the third, which they all\nwear girt twice round about the middle; and you see few great persons\nabout this court who are not adorned with one of these girdles.\nThe horses of the army , and those of the royal stables, having been daily\nled before me, were no longer shy, but would come up to my very feet\nwithout starting.  The riders would leap them over my hand, as I held it on\nthe ground; and one of the emperor’s huntsmen, upon a large courser , took\nmy foot, shoe and all; which was indeed a prodigious leap. I had the goodfortune to divert the emperor one day after a very extraordinary manner . I\ndesired he would order several sticks of two feet high, and the thickness of\nan ordinary cane, to be brought me; whereupon his majesty commanded t",
    "emperor one day after a very extraordinary manner . I\ndesired he would order several sticks of two feet high, and the thickness of\nan ordinary cane, to be brought me; whereupon his majesty commanded the\nmaster of his woods to give directions accordingly; and the next morning\nsix woodmen arrived with as many carriages, drawn by eight horses to\neach. I took nine of these sticks , and fixing them firmly in the ground in a\nquadrangular figure, two feet and a half square, I took four other sticks, and\ntied them  parallel at each corner, about two feet from the ground; then I\nfastened my handkerchief to the nine sticks that stood erect; and extended it\non all sides, till it was tight as the top of a drum; and the four parallel sticks,\nrising about five inches higher than the handkerchief, served as ledges on\neach side. When  I had finished my work, I desired the emperor to let a troop\nof his best horses twenty-four in number , come and exercise upon this plain.\nHis majesty approved of the pr",
    " as ledges on\neach side. When  I had finished my work, I desired the emperor to let a troop\nof his best horses twenty-four in number , come and exercise upon this plain.\nHis majesty approved of the proposal, and I took them up, one by one, in\nmy hand s, ready mounted and armed, with the proper officers to exercise\nthem. As soon as they got into order they divided into two parties,\nperformed mock skirmishes, dischar ged blunt arrows, drew their swords,\nfled and pursued, attacked and retired, and in short discovered the best\nmilitary discipline I ever beheld. The parallel sticks secured them and their\nhorses from falling over the stage; and the emperor was so much delighted,\nthat he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several days, and once was\npleased to be lifted up and give the word of command; and with great\ndifficulty persuaded even the empress herself to let me hold her in her close\nchair within two yards of the stage, when she was able to take a full view of\nthe whole perfor",
    " of command; and with great\ndifficulty persuaded even the empress herself to let me hold her in her close\nchair within two yards of the stage, when she was able to take a full view of\nthe whole performance. It was my good fortune, that no ill accident\nhappened in these entertainments; only once a fiery horse, that belonged to\none of the captai ns, pawing with his hoof, struck a hole in my handkerchief,\nand his foot slipping, he overthrew his rider and himself; but I immediately\nrelieved them both, and covering the hole with one hand, I set down the\ntroop with the other , in the same manner as I took them up. The horse that\nfell was strained in the left shou lder, but the rider got no hurt; and I repaired\nmy handkerchief as well as I could: however , I would not trust to the\nstrength of it any more, in such dangerous enterprises.\nAbout two or three days before I was set at liberty , as I was entertaining\nthe court with this kind of feat, there arrived an express to inform his\nmajesty , ",
    "any more, in such dangerous enterprises.\nAbout two or three days before I was set at liberty , as I was entertaining\nthe court with this kind of feat, there arrived an express to inform his\nmajesty , that some of his subje cts, riding near the place where  I was first\ntaken up, had seen a great black substance lying on the ground , very oddlyshaped, extendin g its edges round, as wide as his majesty’ s bedchamber ,\nand rising up in the middle as high as a man; that it was no living creature,\nas they at first apprehended, for it lay on the grass without motion; and\nsome of them had walked round it several times; that, by mounting upon\neach other ’s shoulders, they had got to the top, which was flat and even,\nand, stamping upon it, they found that it was hollow within; that they\nhumbly conceiv ed it might be something belonging to the man-mountain;\nand if his majesty pleased, they would undertake to bring it with only five\nhorses.

    "iv ed it might be something belonging to the man-mountain;\nand if his majesty pleased, they would undertake to bring it with only five\nhorses. I present ly knew what they meant, and was glad at heart to receive\nthis intelligence . It seems, upon my first reaching the shore after our\nshipwreck, I was in such confus ion, that before I came to the place where I\nwent to sleep, my hat, which I had fastened with a string to my head while I\nwas rowing, and had stuck on all the time I was swimming, fell off after I\ncame to land; the string, as I conjecture, breaking by some accident, which I\nnever observed, but thought my hat had been lost at sea. I entreated his\nimperial majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon as\npossible, describing to him the use and the nature of it: and the next day the\nwaggoners arriv ed with it, but not in a very good condition; they had bored\ntwo holes in the brim, within an inch and half of the edge, and fastened two\nhooks in the holes; these hooks we",
    "ext day the\nwaggoners arriv ed with it, but not in a very good condition; they had bored\ntwo holes in the brim, within an inch and half of the edge, and fastened two\nhooks in the holes; these hooks were tied by a long cord to the harness, and\nthus my hat was dragged along  for above half an English mile; but, the\nground in that country being extremely smooth and level, it received less\ndamage than I expected.\nTwo days after this adventure, the emperor , having ordered that part of\nhis army which quarters in and about his metropolis, to be in readiness, took\na fancy of diverting himself in a very singular manner . He desired I would\nstand like a Colossus, with my legs as far asunder as I conveni ently could.\nHe then commanded his general (who was an old experienced leader , and a\ngreat patron of mine) to draw up the troops in close order , and march them\nunder me; the foot by twenty-four abreast, and the horse by sixteen, with\ndrums beating, colours flying, and pikes advanced.

This body consisted of\nthree thousand foot, and a thousand horse. His majesty gave orders, upon\npain of death, that every soldier in his march should observe the strictest\ndecency with regard to my person; which however could not prevent some\nof the younger officers from turning up their eyes as they passe d under me:\nand, to confess the truth, my breeches were at that time in so ill a condition,\nthat they af forded some opportunities for laughter and admiration.I had sent so many memorial s and petitions for my liberty , that his\nmajesty at length mentioned the matter , first in the cabinet, and then in a\nfull coun cil; where it was opposed by none, except Skyresh Bolgolam, who\nwas pleased, without any provocation, to be my mortal enemy .

But it was\ncarried against him by the whole  board, and confirmed by the emperor . That\nminister was galbet , or admiral of the realm, very much in his master ’s\nconfidence, and a person well versed in affairs, but of a morose and sour\ncomplexion. However , he was at length persuaded to comply; but prevailed\nthat the articles  and conditions upon which I should be set free, and to\nwhich I must swear , should be drawn up by himself. These articles were\nbrought to me by Skyresh Bolgolam in person attended by two under -\nsecretaries, and several persons  of distinction. After they were  read, I was\ndemanded to swear to the performance of them; first in the manner of my\nown country, and afterwards in the method prescribed by their laws; which\nwas, to hold my right foot in my left hand, and to place the middle finger of\nmy right hand on the crown of my",

The people had notice, by proclamation, of my design to\nvisit the town. The wall which encompassed it is two feet and a half high,\nand at least eleven inches broad , so that a coach and horses may be driven\nvery safely round it; and it is flanked with strong towers at ten feet distance.\nI stepped over the great western gate, and passed very gently , and sidling,\nthrough the two principal stree ts, only in my short waistcoat,  for fear of\ndamaging the roofs and eaves of the houses with the skirts of my coat.

The garret\nwindows and tops of houses were so crowded with spectators, that I thought\nin all my travels I had not seen a more populous place. The city is an exact\nsquare, each side of the wall being five hundred feet long. The two great\nstreets, which run across and divide it into four quarters, are five feet wide.\nThe lanes and alleys, which I could not enter , but only view them as I\npassed, are from twelve to eighteen inches. The town is capable of holding\nfive hundred thousand souls: the houses are from three to five stories: the\nshops and markets well provided.\nThe emperor ’s palace is in the centre of the city where the two great\nstreets meet.

    "\nshops and markets well provided.\nThe emperor ’s palace is in the centre of the city where the two great\nstreets meet. It is enclosed by a wall of two feet high, and twenty feet\ndistance from the buildings. I had his majesty’ s permission to step over this\nwall; and, the space being so wide between that and the palace, I couldeasily view it on every side. The outward court is a square of forty feet, and\nincludes two other courts: in the inmost are the royal apartments, which I\nwas very desirous to see, but found it extremely difficult; for the great\ngates, from one square into another , were but eighteen inche s high, and\nseven inches wide. Now the buildings of the outer court were at least five\nfeet high, and it was impossible for me to stride over them without infinite\ndamage to the pile, though the walls were strongly built of hewn stone, and\nfour inches thick.

At the same time the emperor had a great desire that I\nshould see the magnificence of his palace; but this I was not able to do till\nthree days after, which I spent in cutting down with my knife some of the\nlargest trees in the royal park, about a hundred yards distant from the city.\nOf these trees I made two stools, each about three feet high, and strong\nenough to bear my weight. The people having received notic e a second\ntime, I went again through the city to the palace with my two stools in my\nhands. When I came to the side of the outer court, I stood upon one stool,\nand took the other in my hand; this I lifted over the roof, and gently set it\ndown on the space between the first and second court, which was eight feet\nwide. I then stept over the build ing very conveniently from one stool to the\nother , and drew up the first after me with a hooked stick. By this\ncontrivance I got into the inmo st court; and,",

By this\ncontrivance I got into the inmo st court; and, lying down upon my side, I\napplied my face to the windows of the middle stories, which were left open\non purpose, and discovered the most splendid apartments that can be\nimagined. There  I saw the empress and the young princes, in their several\nlodgings, with their chief attendants about them. Her imperial majesty was\npleased to smile very graciously upon me, and gave me out of the window\nher hand to kiss.\nBut I shall not anticipate the reader with further descriptions of this kind,\nbecause I reserve them for a greater work, which is now almo st ready for\nthe press; containing a general  description of this empire, from its first\nerection, through a long series of princes; with a particular account of their\nwars and politics, laws, learning, and religion; their plants and animals;\ntheir p",

I offered to lie\ndown that he might the more conveniently reach my ear, but he chose rather\nto let me hold him in my hand during our conversation. He began with\ncompliments on my liberty; said “he might pretend to some merit in it;” but,\nhowever , added,  “that if it had not been for the present situation  of things at\ncourt, perhaps I might not have obtained it so soon. For,” said he, “as\nflourishing a condition as we may appear to be in to foreigners, we labour\nunder two mighty evils: a violent faction at home, and the danger of an\ninvasion, by a most potent enemy , from abroad. As to the first, you are to\nunderstand, that for about seventy moons past there have been two\nstruggling parties in this empire, under the names of T ramecksan  and\nSlamecksan , from the high and low heels of their shoes, by which they\ndistinguish themselves.

It is alleged, indeed, that the high heels are most\nagreeable to our ancient constitu tion; but, however this be, his majesty has\ndetermined to make use only of low heels in the administration of the\ngovernment, and all offices in the gift of the crown, as you cannot but\nobserve; and particularly that his majesty’ s imperial heels are lower at least\nby a drurr  than any of his court ( drurr  is a measure about the fourtee nth\npart of an inch).  The animosities between these two parties run so high, that\nthey will neithe r eat, nor drink, nor talk with each other . We compute the\nT ramecksan , or high heels, to exceed us in number; but the power is wholly\non our side.

We apprehend his imperial highness, the heir to the crown, to\nhave some tende ncy towards the high heels; at least we can plainly discover\nthat one of his heels is higher than the other , which gives him a hobble in\nhis gait. Now , in the midst of these intestine disquiets, we are threatened\nwith an invasion from the island of Blefuscu, which is the other great\nempire of the universe, almost as large and powerful as this of his majesty .\nFor as to what we have heard you affirm, that there are other kingdoms and\nstates in the world inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself, our\nphilosophers are in much doubt, and would rather conjecture that you\ndropped from the moon, or one of the stars; because it is certain, that a\nhundred mortals  of your bulk would in a short time destroy all the fruits and\ncattle of his majesty’ s dominions: besides, our histories of six thousand\nmoons make no mention of any other regions than the two great empires ofLilliput and Blefuscu.

Which two mighty powers have, as I was going to\ntell you, been engaged in a most obstinate war for six-and-thirty moons\npast. It began upon the following occasion. It is allowed on all hands, that\nthe prim itive way of breaking eggs, before we eat them, was upon the larger\nend; but his present majesty’ s grandfather , while he was a boy, going to eat\nan egg, and breaking it according to the ancient practice, happened to cut\none of his fingers. Whereupon the emperor his father publish ed an edict,\ncommanding all his subjects, upon great penalties, to break the smaller end\nof their eggs. The people so highly resented this law, that our histories tell\nus, there have been six rebell ions raised on that account; wherein one\nemperor lost his life, and another his crown.

    "ighly resented this law, that our histories tell\nus, there have been six rebell ions raised on that account; wherein one\nemperor lost his life, and another his crown. These civil commotions were\nconstantly fomented by the monarchs of Blefuscu; and when they were\nquelled, the exiles always fled for refuge to that empire. It is computed that\neleven thousand  persons have at several times suffered death, rather than\nsubmit to break their eggs at the smaller end. Many hundred large volumes\nhave been published upon this controversy: but the books of the Big-\nendians have been long forbidd en, and the whole party rendere d incapable\nby law of holdi ng employment s. During the course of these troubles, the\nemperors of Blefuscu did frequently expostulate by their ambassadors,\naccusing us of making a schism in religion, by offending  against a\nfundamental doctrine of our great prophet Lustrog, in the fifty-fourth\nchapter of the Blundecral (which is their Alcoran).

This, however , is\nthought to be a mere strain upon the text; for the words are these: ‘that all\ntrue believers break their eggs at the convenient end.’  And which is the\nconvenient end, seems, in my humble opinion to be left to every man’ s\nconscience, or at least in the power of the chief magistrate to determine.\nNow , the Big-en dian exiles have found so much credit in the emperor of\nBlefuscu’ s court , and so much private assistance and encouragement from\ntheir party here at home, that a bloody war has been carried on between the\ntwo empires for six-and-thirty moons, with various success; during which\ntime we have lost forty capital ships, and a much greater number of smaller\nvessels, together with thirty thousand of our best seamen and soldiers; and\nthe damage received by the enemy is reckoned to be somewhat great",

However , they have now equipped a numerous fleet, and are just\npreparing to make a descent upon us; and his imperial maje sty, placing\ngreat confidence in your valour and strength, has commanded me to lay this\naccount of his af fairs before you.”I desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the emperor; and to\nlet him know , “that I thought it would not become me, who was a foreigner ,\nto interfere with parties; but I was ready , with the hazard of my life, to\ndefend his person and state against all invaders.”CHAPTER V.\nThe author , by an extraordinary stratagem, prevents an\ninvasion.

The empress’ s apartment on fire by an accident;\nthe author instrumental in saving the rest of the palace.\nThe empire of Blefuscu is an island situated to the north-east of Lilliput,\nfrom which it is parted only by a channel of eight hundred yards  wide. I had\nnot yet seen it, and upon this notice of an intended invasion , I avoided\nappearing on that side of the coast, for fear of being discovered, by some of\nthe enemy’ s ships, who had received no intelligence of me; all intercourse\nbetween the two empires havin g been strictly forbidden during the war,\nupon pain of death, and an embar go laid by our emperor upon  all vessels\nwhatsoever .

    "jesty a project I had formed of\nseizing the enemy’ s whole fleet; which, as our scouts assured us, lay at\nanchor in the harbour , ready to sail with the first fair wind. I consulted the\nmost experience d seamen upon the depth of the channel, which they had\noften plumbed; who told me, that in the middle, at high-water , it was\nseventy glumgluffs  deep, which is about six feet of European measure; and\nthe rest of it fifty glumgluffs  at most. I walked towards the north-east coast,\nover against Blefuscu, where, lying down behind a hillock, I took out my\nsmall perspectiv e glass, and viewed the enemy’ s fleet at ancho r, consisting\nof about fifty men of war, and a great number of transports: I then came\nback to my house, and gave orders (for which I had a warrant)  for a great\nquantity of the strongest cable and bars of iron. The cable was about as\nthick as packthre ad and the bars of the length and size of a knitting-needle. I\ntrebled the cable to make it stronger , and for the same reaso",

I\ntrebled the cable to make it stronger , and for the same reason I twisted three\nof the iron bars together , bendin g the extremities into a hook. Having thus\nfixed fifty hooks to as many cables, I went back to the north-eas t coast, and\nputting off my coat, shoes, and stockings, walked into the sea, in my\nleathern jerkin, about half an hour before high water . I waded with whathaste I could, and swam in the middle about thirty yards, till I felt ground. I\narrived at the fleet in less than half an hour. The enemy was so frightened\nwhen they saw me, that they leaped out of their ships, and swam to shore,\nwhere there could not be fewer  than thirty thousand souls. I then took my\ntackling, and, fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each, I tied all the\ncords together at the end. While I was thus employed, the enemy dischar ged\nseveral thousand arro",
    " souls. I then took my\ntackling, and, fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each, I tied all the\ncords together at the end. While I was thus employed, the enemy dischar ged\nseveral thousand arrows, many of which stuck in my hands and face, and,\nbeside the excessive smart, gave me much disturbance in my work. My\ngreatest apprehe nsion was for my eyes, which I should have infallibly lost,\nif I had not suddenly thought of an expedient. I kept, among other little\nnecessaries, a pair of spectacles in a private pocket, which, as I observed\nbefore, had escaped the emperor ’s searchers. These I took out and fastened\nas strongly as I could upon my nose, and thus armed, went on boldly with\nmy work , in spite of the enemy’ s arrows, many of which struck against the\nglasses of my spectacles, but without any other effect, further than a little to\ndiscompose them .

I had now fastened all the hooks, and, taking the knot in\nmy hand, began to pull; but not a ship would stir, for they were all too fast\nheld by their anchors, so that the boldest part of my enterprise remained. I\ntherefore let go the cord, and leaving the hooks fixed to the ships, I\nresolutely cut with my knife the cables that fastened the anchors, receiving\nabout two hundred shots in my face and hands; then I took up the knotted\nend of the cable s, to which my hooks were tied, and with great ease drew\nfifty of the enemy’ s largest men of war after me.\nThe Blefuscudia ns, who had not the least imagination of what I intended,\nwere at first confounded with astonishment. They had seen me cut the\ncables, and thought my design was only to let the ships run adrift or fall\nfoul on each other: but when they perceived the whole fleet moving in\norder , and saw me pulling at the end, they set up such a scream of grief and\ndespa",

When I had got\nout of danger , I stopped awhile to pick out the arrows that stuck in my\nhands and face;  and rubbed on some of the same ointment that was given\nme at my first arrival, as I have formerly mentioned. I then took off my\nspectacles, and waiting about an hour, till the tide was a little fallen, I\nwaded through the middle with my cargo, and arrived safe at the royal port\nof Lilliput.\nThe emperor and his whole court stood on the shore, expecting  the issue\nof this great adventure.

The emperor concluded me to be drowned,\nand that the enemy’ s fleet was approaching in a hostile manner: but he was\nsoon eased of his fears; for the channel growing shallower every step I\nmade, I came in a short time within hearing, and holding up the end of the\ncable, by which the fleet was fastened, I cried in a loud voice,  “Long live\nthe most puissant king of Lilliput!” This great prince received me at my\nlanding with all possible encomiums, and created me a nar dac upon the\nspot, which is the highest title of honour among them.\nHis majesty desired I would take some other opportunity of bringing all\nthe rest of his enemy’ s ships into his ports. And so unmeasur eable is the\nambition of princes, that he seemed to think of nothing less than reducing\nthe whole empire of Blefuscu into a province, and governing ",

And so unmeasur eable is the\nambition of princes, that he seemed to think of nothing less than reducing\nthe whole empire of Blefuscu into a province, and governing it, by a\nviceroy; of destroying the Big-e ndian exiles, and compelling that people to\nbreak the smaller end of their eggs, by which he would remain the sole\nmonarch of the whole world. But I endeavoured to divert him from this\ndesign, by many arguments drawn from the topics of policy  as well as\njustice; and I plainly protested , “that I would never be an instrument of\nbringing a free and brave people into slavery .” And, when the matter was\ndebated in council, the wisest part of the ministry were of my opinion.\nThis open bold declaration of mine was so opposite to the schemes and\npolitics of his imperial majesty , that he could never forgive me.

And from this time began an\nintrigue between his majesty and a junto of ministers, maliciously bent\nagainst me, which broke out in less than two months, and had like to have\nended in my utter destruction. Of so little weight are the greatest services to\nprinces, when put into the balance with a refusal to gratify their passions.\nAbout three weeks after this exploit, there arrived a solemn embassy\nfrom Blefuscu, with humble offers of a peace, which was soon concluded,\nupon conditions very advantage ous to our emperor , wherewith I shall not\ntrouble the reader .

However , it\nwas not long before I had an opportunity of doing his majesty , at least as I\nthen thought, a most signal service. I was alarmed at midnight with the cries\nof many hundred people at my door; by which, being suddenly awaked, I\nwas in some kind of terror . I heard the word Bur glum  repeated incessantly:\nseveral of the emperor ’s court, making their way through the crowd,\nentreated me to come immediately to the palace, where her imperial\nmajesty’ s apartm ent was on fire, by the carelessness of a maid of honour ,\nwho fell asleep while she was reading a romance.

I found they had already applied ladders to the walls of\nthe apartment, and were well provided with buckets, but the water was at\nsome distance. These buckets were about the size of large thimbles, and the\npoor people supplied me with them as fast as they could: but the flame was\nso violent that they did little good. I might easily have stifled it with my\ncoat, which I unfortunately left behind me for haste, and came away only in\nmy leathern jerkin. The case seemed wholly desperate and deplorable; and\nthis magnificent palace would  have infallibly been burnt down to the\nground, if, by a presence of mind unusual to me, I had not suddenly thought\nof an expedient.

    "ind unusual to me, I had not suddenly thought\nof an expedient. I had, the evening before, drunk plentifully of a most\ndelicious wine called glimigrim , (the Blefuscudi ans call it flunec , but ours is\nesteemed the better sort,) which  is very diuretic. By the luckiest chance in\nthe world, I had not dischar ged myself of any part of it. The heat I had\ncontracted by coming very near the flames, and by labouring  to quench\nthem, made the wine begin to operate by urine; which I voide d in such a\nquantity , and applied so well to the proper places, that in three minutes the\nfire was wholly extinguished, and the rest of that noble pile, which had cost\nso many ages in erecting, preserved from destruction.It was now day-light, and I returned to my house without waiting to\ncongratulate with the emperor: because, although I had done a very eminent\npiece of service, yet I could not tell how his majesty might resent the\nmanner by which I had perform ed it: for, by the fundamental laws of the\nrealm",

But I was a little comforted by a message\nfrom his majest y, “that he would give orders to the grand justiciary for\npassing my pardon in form:” which, however , I could not obtain; and I was\nprivately assured , “that the empress, conceiving the greatest abhorrence of\nwhat I had done, removed to the most distant side of the court, firmly\nresolved that those buildings should never be repaired for her use: and, in\nthe presence of her chief confidents could not forbear vowing revenge.”CHAPTER VI.\nOf the inhabitants of Lilliput; their learning, laws, and\ncustoms; the manner of educating their children.

His vindication of a\ngreat lady .\nAlthough I intend to leave the description of this empire to a particular\ntreatise, yet, in the mean time, I am content to gratify the curious reader\nwith some gene ral ideas. As the common size of the natives is somewhat\nunder six inches high, so there is an exact proportion in all other  animals, as\nwell as plants and trees: for instance, the tallest horses and oxen are\nbetween four and five inches in height, the sheep an inch and half, more or\nless: their geese about the bigness of a sparrow , and so the several\ngradations downwards till you come to the smallest, which to my sight,\nwere almost invisible; but nature has adapted the eyes of the Lilliputians to\nall objects proper for their view : they see with great exactnes s, but at no\ngreat distance.

And, to show the sharpness of their sight towards objects\nthat are near, I have been much pleased with observing a cook pulling a\nlark, which was not so large as a common fly; and a young girl threading an\ninvisible needle  with invisible silk. Their tallest trees are about seven feet\nhigh: I mean some of those in the great royal park, the tops whereof I could\nbut just reach with my fist clenched. The other vegetables are in the same\nproportion; but this I leave to the reader ’s imagination.\nI shall say but little at present of their learning, which, for many ages, has\nflourished in all its branches among them: but their manner of writing is\nvery peculiar, being neither from the left to the right, like the Europeans,\nnor from the right to the left, like the Arabians, nor from up to down, like\nthe Chinese, but aslant, from one corner ",

The learned among them confess the absurdity of this\ndoctrine; but the practice still continues, in compliance to the vulgar .\nThere are some laws and customs in this empire very peculiar; and if they\nwere not so directly contrary to those of my own dear country , I should be\ntempted to say a little in their justification.

    " to those of my own dear country , I should be\ntempted to say a little in their justification. It is only to be wishe d they were\nas well executed. The first I shall mention, relates to informers. All crimes\nagainst the state, are punished here with the utmost severity;  but, if the\nperson accused makes his innocence plainly to appear upon his trial, the\naccuser is immediately put to an ignominious death; and out of his goods or\nlands the innocent person is quadruply recompensed for the loss of his time,\nfor the danger he underwent, for the hardship of his imprisonment, and for\nall the charges he has been at in making his defence; or, if that fund be\ndeficient, it is largely supplied by the crown. The emperor also confers on\nhim some public mark of his favour , and proclamation is made of his\ninnocence through the whole city .\nThey look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft, and therefore seldom\nfail to punish it with death; for they allege, that care and vigila nce, with a\nvery com",
    "his\ninnocence through the whole city .\nThey look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft, and therefore seldom\nfail to punish it with death; for they allege, that care and vigila nce, with a\nvery common understanding, may preserve a man’ s goods from  thieves, but\nhonesty has no defence against superior cunning; and, since it is necessary\nthat there should be a perpetual intercourse of buying and selling, and\ndealing upon credit, where fraud is permitted and connived at, or has no law\nto punis h it, the honest dealer is always undone, and the knave gets the\nadvantage. I remember , when I was once interceding with the emperor for a\ncriminal who had wronged his master of a great sum of money , which he\nhad received by order and ran away with; and happening to tell his majesty ,\nby way of extenuation, that it was only a breach of trust, the emperor\nthought it monstrous in me to offer as a defence the greatest aggravation of\nthe crime; and truly I had little to say in return, farther than",

Whoever can there bring\nsufficient proof,  that he has strictly observed the laws of his country for\nseventy-three moons, has a claim to certain privileges, according to hisquality or condition of life, with a proportionable sum of money out of a\nfund appropriated for that use: he likewise acquires the title of snilpall , or\nlegal, which is added to his name, but does not descend to his posterity .

And\nthese people thought it a prodigious defect of policy among us, when I told\nthem that our laws were enforced only by penalties, without any mention of\nreward. It is upon this account that the image of Justice, in their courts of\njudicature, is formed with six eyes, two before, as many behind, and on\neach side one, to signify circum spection; with a bag of gold open in her\nright hand, and a sword sheathed in her left, to show she is more disposed to\nreward than to punish.\nIn choosing persons for all employments, they have more regar d to good\nmorals than to great abilities; for, since government is necessary to\nmankind, they believe, that the common size of human understanding is\nfitted to some station or other; and that Providence never intended to make\nthe management  of public affairs a mystery to be comprehende d only by a\nfew persons of sublime genius, of which there seld",
    "fitted to some station or other; and that Providence never intended to make\nthe management  of public affairs a mystery to be comprehende d only by a\nfew persons of sublime genius, of which there seldom are three born in an\nage: but they suppose truth, justice, temperance, and the like, to be in every\nman’ s power; the practice of which virtues, assisted by experience and a\ngood intention, would qualify any man for the service of his country, except\nwhere a course of study is required. But they thought the want of moral\nvirtues was so far from being supplied by superior endowments of the mind,\nthat employments could never be put into such dangerous hands  as those of\npersons so qualified; and, at least, that the mistakes committed by\nignorance, in a virtuous disposition, would never be of such fatal\nconsequence to the public weal, as the practices of a man, whose\ninclinations led him to be corrup t, and who had great abilities to manage, to\nmultiply , and defend his corruptions.\nIn lik",

For, since the conjunction of male and female is\nfounded upon the great law of nature, in order to propagate and continue the\nspecies, the Lilliputians will needs have it, that men and women are joined\ntogether , like other animals, by the motives of concupiscence; and that their\ntenderness towards their young proceeds from the ",
    "ies, the Lilliputians will needs have it, that men and women are joined\ntogether , like other animals, by the motives of concupiscence; and that their\ntenderness towards their young proceeds from the like natural principle: for\nwhich reason they will never allow that a child is under any obligation to\nhis father for begetting him, or to his mother for bringing him into the\nworld; which, considering the miseries of human life, was neither a benefit\nin itself, nor intended so by his parents, whose thoughts, in their love\nencounters, were otherwise employed. Upon these, and the like reasonings,\ntheir opinion is, that parents are the last of all others to be trusted with the\neducation of their own children; and therefore they have in every town\npublic nurseries , where all parents, except cottagers and labourers, are\nobliged to send their infants of both sexes to be reared and educated, when\nthey come to the age of twenty moons, at which time they are supposed to\nhave some rudiments of doc",
    "agers and labourers, are\nobliged to send their infants of both sexes to be reared and educated, when\nthey come to the age of twenty moons, at which time they are supposed to\nhave some rudiments of docility . These schools are of several kinds, suited\nto different qualities, and both sexes. They have certain professors well\nskilled in preparing children for such a condition of life as befits the rank of\ntheir parents, and their own capacities, as well as inclinations. I shall first\nsay something of the male nurseries, and then of the female.\nThe nurseries for males of noble or eminent birth, are provided with\ngrave and learned professors, and their several deputies. The clothes and\nfood of the child ren are plain and simple.

They are dressed by men till four years of\nage, and then are obliged to dress themselves, although their quality be ever\nso great; and the women attendant, who are aged proportionably to ours at\nfifty, perform only the most menial offices. They are never suffered to\nconverse with servants, but go together in smaller or greater numbers to\ntake their diversions, and alway s in the presence of a professor , or one of\nhis depu ties; whereby they avoid those early bad impressions of folly and\nvice, to which our children are subject. Their parents are suffered to see\nthem only twice a year; the visit is to last but an hour; they are allowed to\nkiss the child at meeting and parting; but a professor , who always stands by\non those  occasi ons, will not suffer them to whi",

And if it be found that these nurses\never presume to entertain the girls with frightful or foolish stories, or the\ncommon follies practised by chambermaids among us, they are publicly\nwhipped thrice about the city, imprisoned for a year, and banishe d for life to\nthe most desolate part of the country . Thus the young ladies are as much\nashamed of being cowards and fools as the men, and despise all personal\nornaments, beyond decency and cleanliness: neither did I perceive any\ndifference in their education made by their difference of sex, only that the\nexercises of the females were not altogether so robust; and that some rules\nwere given them relating to domestic life, and a smaller compas",
    "eir education made by their difference of sex, only that the\nexercises of the females were not altogether so robust; and that some rules\nwere given them relating to domestic life, and a smaller compass of\nlearning was enjoined them: for their maxim is, that among peoples of\nquality , a wife should be alwa ys a reasonable and agreeable companion,\nbecause she cannot always be young. When the girls are twelve years old,which among them is the marri ageable age, their parents or guardians take\nthem home, with great expressions of gratitude to the professors, and\nseldom without tears of the young lady and her companions.\nIn the nurseries of females of the meaner sort, the children are instructed\nin all kinds of works proper for their sex, and their several degrees: those\nintended for apprentices are dismissed at seven years old, the rest are kept\nto eleven.\nThe meaner families who have  children at these nurseries, are obliged,\nbesides their annual pension, which is as low as possible, to r",

For the Lilliputians think nothing can be more unjust, than for\npeople, in subservience to their own appetites, to bring child ren into the\nworld, and leave the burthen of supporting them on the public. As to\npersons of quality , they give security to appropriate a certain sum for each\nchild, suitable to their condition; and these funds are always managed with\ngood husbandry and the most exact justice.\nThe cottagers and labourers keep their children at home, their business\nbeing only to till and cultivate the earth, and therefore their education is of\nlittle consequence to the public: but the old and diseased among t",

Having a head mechanically\nturned, and being likewise forced by necessity , I had made for myself a\ntable and chair convenient enough, out of the largest trees in the royal park.\nTwo hundred sempstresses were employed to make me shirts, and linen for\nmy bed and table, all of the strongest and coarsest kind they could get;\nwhich, however , they were forced to quilt together in several folds, for the\nthickest was some degrees finer than lawn.

The sempstresse s took my\nmeasure as I lay on the ground, one standing at my neck, and another at my\nmid-leg, with a strong cord extended, that each held by the end, while a\nthird measured the length of the cord with a rule of an inch long. Then they\nmeasured my right thumb, and desired no more; for by a mathematical\ncomputation, that twice round the thumb is once round the wrist, and so onto the neck and the waist, and by the help of my old shirt, which I displayed\non the ground before them for a pattern, they fitted me exactly . Three\nhundred tailors were employed in the same manner to make me clothes; but\nthey had another contrivance for taking my measure.

I kneeled  down, and\nthey raised a ladder from the ground to my neck; upon this ladder one of\nthem mounted, and let fall a plumb-line from my collar to the floor , which\njust answ ered the length of my coat: but my waist and arms I measured\nmyself. When my clothes were finished, which was done in my house (for\nthe largest of theirs would not have been able to hold them), they looked\nlike the patch-w ork made by the ladies in England, only that mine were all\nof a colour .\nI had three hundred cooks to dress my victuals, in little convenient huts\nbuilt about my house, where they and their families lived, and prepared me\ntwo dishes a-pie ce. I took up twenty waiters in my hand, and placed them\non the table: a hundred more attended below on the ground, some with\ndishes of meat, and some with barrels of wine and other liquors slung on\ntheir shoulders; all which the waiters above drew up, as I wanted, in a very\ningenious mann er, by certain c",

A dish of their meat was a good mouthful, and a barrel of their\nliquor a reasona ble draught. Their mutton yields to ours, but their beef is\nexcellent. I have had a sirloin so large, that I have been forced to make three\nbites of it; but this is rare. My servants were astonished to see me eat it,\nbones and all, as in our country we do the leg of a lark. Their geese and\nturkeys I usually ate at a mouth ful, and I confess they far exceed ours. Of\ntheir smaller fowl I could take up twenty or thirty at the end of my knife.\nOne day his imperial majesty , being informed of my way of living,\ndesired “that himself and his royal consort, with the young princes of the\nblood of both sexes, might have  the happiness,” as he was pleased to call it,\n“of d",

I have some private\nreasons to believe, that this visit from his majesty gave Flimnap an\nopportunity of doing me ill offices to his master .

The treasurer took a fancy to be\njealous of his wife, from the malice of some evil tongues, who informed\nhim that her grace had taken a violent affection for my person; and the court\nscandal ran for some time, that she once came privately to my lodging.

I own she came often to my house, but always\npublicly , nor ever without three more in the coach, who were usually her\nsister and young daughter , and some particular acquaintance; but this was\ncommon to many other ladies of the court. And I still appeal to my servants\nround, whether they at any time saw a coach at my door, without knowing\nwhat persons were in it. On those occasions, when a servant had given me\nnotice, my custom was to go immediately to the door, and, after paying my\nrespects, to take up the coach and two horses very carefully in my hands\n(for, if there were six horses, the postillion always unharnessed four,) and\nplace them on a table, where I had fixed a movable rim quite round, of ",

And I have often had four coaches and\nhorses at once on my table, full of company , while I sat in my chair, leaning\nmy face towards  them; and when I was engaged with one set, the coachmen\nwould gently drive the others round my table.

These false informations, which I afterwards came to the\nknowledge of by an accident not proper to mention, made the treasurer\nshow his lady for some time an ill countenance, and me a worse; and\nalthough he was at last undeceived and reconciled to her, yet I lost all credit\nwith him, and found my interest decline very fast with the empe ror himself,\nwho was, indeed, too much governed by that favourite.CHAPTER VII.\nThe author, being informed of a design to accuse him of\nhigh-treason, makes his escape to Blefuscu.

I had indeed heard and read\nenough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers, but never\nexpected to have found such terrible effects of them, in so remo te a country ,\ngoverned, as I thought, by very dif ferent maxims from those in Europe.\nWhen I was just preparing to pay my attendance on the emperor of\nBlefuscu, a considerable person at court (to whom I had been very\nserviceable, at a time when he lay under the highest displeasure of his\nimperial majesty ) came to my house very pri",
    "on the emperor of\nBlefuscu, a considerable person at court (to whom I had been very\nserviceable, at a time when he lay under the highest displeasure of his\nimperial majesty ) came to my house very privately at night, in a close chair ,\nand, without sending his name, desired admittance. The chairmen were\ndismissed; I put the chair , with his lordship in it, into my coat-pocket: and,\ngiving orders to a trusty servant, to say I was indisposed and gone to sleep, I\nfastened the door of my house, placed the chair on the table, according to\nmy usual custom , and sat down  by it. After the common salutations were\nover, observing his lordship’ s countenance full of concern, and inquiring\ninto the reason, he desired “I would hear him with patience, in a matter that\nhighly concerned my honour and my life.” His speech was to the following\neffect, for I took notes of it as soon as he left me:—\n“You are to know,” said he, “that several committees of council have\nbeen lately called, in the most priva",
    "life.” His speech was to the following\neffect, for I took notes of it as soon as he left me:—\n“You are to know,” said he, “that several committees of council have\nbeen lately called, in the most private manner , on your account; and it is but\ntwo days since his majesty came to a full resolution.\n“You are very sensible that Skyresh Bolgolam” (galbet , or high-admiral)\n“has been your mortal enemy , almost ever since your arrival. His originalreasons I know not; but his hatred is increased since your great success\nagainst Blefuscu, by which his glory as admiral is much obscured. This\nlord, in conjunction with Flimnap the high-treasurer , whose enmity against\nyou is notoriou s on account of his lady, Limtoc the general,  Lalcon the\nchamberlain, and Balmuf f the grand justiciary , have prepared articles of\nimpeachment against you, for treason and other capital crimes.”\nThis preface made me so impatient, being conscious of my own merits\nand innocence, that I was going  to interrupt him; when",
    " articles of\nimpeachment against you, for treason and other capital crimes.”\nThis preface made me so impatient, being conscious of my own merits\nand innocence, that I was going  to interrupt him; when he entreated me to\nbe silent, and thus proceeded:—\n“Out of gratitude for the favours you have done me, I procured\ninformation of the whole proceedings, and a copy of the articles; wherein I\nventure my head for your service.\n“‘Articles of Impeachment against  QUINBUS FLESTRIN, (the\nMan-Mountain .)\nARTICLE  I.\n“‘Whereas, by a statute made in the reign of his imperial majesty\nCalin Deffar Plune, it is enacted, that, whoever shall make water\nwithin the precincts of the royal  palace, shall be liable to the pains and\npenalties of high-treason; notwithstanding, the said Quinbus Flestrin,\nin open breach of the said law, under colour of extinguishing the fire\nkindled in the apartment of his majesty’ s most dear imperial consort,\ndid maliciously , traitorously , and devilishly , by dischar ge of h",

The\ntreasurer and admiral insisted that you should be put to the most painful and\nignominious death, by setting fire to your house at night, and the general\nwas to attend with twenty thousand men, armed with poisoned arrows, to\nshoot you on the face and hands.

Some of your servants were to have\nprivate orders to strew a poison ous juice on your shirts and sheets, which\nwould soon make you tear your own flesh, and die in the utmost torture.\nThe general came into the same  opinion; so that for a long time there was amajority against you; but his majesty resolving, if possible, to spare your\nlife, at last brought of f the chamberlain.\n“Upon this incident, Reldresal, principal secretary for private affairs, who\nalways approved himself your true friend, was commanded by the emperor\nto deliver his opinion, which he accordingly did; and therein justified the\ngood thoughts you have of him.

He said, the\nfriendship betw een you and him was so well known to the world, that\nperhaps the most honourable board might think him partial; however , in\nobedience to the command he had received, he would freely offer his\nsentiments. That if his majesty , in consideration of your services, and\npursuant to his own merciful disposition, would please to spare your life,\nand only give orders to put out both your eyes, he humbly conceived, that\nby this expedient justice might in some measure be satisfied, and all the\nworld would applaud the lenity of the emperor , as well as the fair and\ngenerous proceedings of those who have the honour to be his counsellors.\nThat the loss of your eyes would be no impediment to your bodily strength,\nby which you might still be useful to his majesty; that blindness is an\naddition",

Bolgolam , the admiral, could not preserve his temper , but, rising up\nin fury, said, he wondered how the secretary durst presume to give his\nopinion for preserving the life of a traitor; that the services you had\nperformed were, by all true reasons of state, the great aggravation of your\ncrimes; that you, who were able to extinguish the fire by dischar ge of urine\nin her majesty’ s apartment (which he mentioned with horror), might, at\nanother time, raise an i",

And\nyour friend the secretary , humbly desiring to be heard again, in answer to\nwhat the treasurer had objected, concerning the great charge his majesty\nwas at in main taining you, said, that his excellency , who had the sole\ndisposal of the emperor",

    "ice of a favourite, the emperor always made a speech\nto his whole council, expressing his great lenity and tenderness,  as qualities\nknown and confessed by all the world. This speech was immediately\npublished throughout the kingd om; nor did any thing terrify the people so\nmuch as those encomiums on his majesty’ s mercy; because it was observed,\nthat the more these praises were enlar ged and insisted on, the more inhuman\nwas the punishm ent, and the sufferer more innocent. Yet, as to myself, I\nmust confess, having never been designed for a courtier , either by my birth\nor education, I was so ill a judge of things, that I could not discover the\nlenity and favour of this senten ce, but conceived it (perhaps erroneously)\nrather to be rigorous than gentle.

    "ial,\nfor, altho ugh I could not deny the facts alleged in the several articles, yet I\nhoped they would admit of some extenuation. But having in my life perused\nmany state-trials, which I ever observed to terminate as the judges thought\nfit to direct, I durst not rely on so dangerous a decision, in so critical a\njuncture, and against such powe rful enemies. Once I was strongly bent upon\nresistance, for, while I had liberty the whole strength of that empire could\nhardly subdue me, and I might easily with stones pelt the metropolis to\npieces; but I soon rejected that project with horror , by remembering the oath\nI had made to the emperor , the favours I received from him, and the high\ntitle of nardac he conferred upon me. Neithe r had I so soon learned the\ngratitude of courtiers, to persuade myself, that his majesty’ s present\nseverities acquitted me of all past obligations.At last, I fixed upon a resolutio n, for which it is probable I may incur\nsome censure, and not unjustly; for I conf",

But\nhurried on by the precipitancy of youth, and having his imperial majesty’ s\nlicense to pay my attendance upon the emperor of Blefuscu,  I took this\nopportunity , before the three days were elapsed, to send a letter to my friend\nthe secretary , signifying my resolution of setting out that morning for\nBlefuscu, pursu ant to the leave I had got; and, without waiting for an\nanswer , I went to that side of the",

I held them in my hands, till I came within two\nhundred yards of the gate, and desired them “to signify my arriv al to one of\nthe secretaries, and let him know , I there waited his majesty’ s command.” I\nhad an answer in about an hour, “that his majesty , attended by the royal\nfamily , and great officers of the court, was coming out to receive me.” I\nadvanc",

Whereupon, I\nreturned immed iately towards the city, and desired his imperial majesty to\nlend me twenty of the tallest vessels he had left, after the loss of his fleet,\nand three thousand seamen, under the command of his vice-admiral. This\nfleet sailed round, while I went back the shortest way to the coast, where I\nfirst discovered the boat. I found the tide had driven it still nearer . The\nseamen were all provided with cordage, which I had beforehand  twisted to a\nsufficient streng th. When the ships came up, I stripped myself,  and waded\ntill I came within a hundred yards of the boat, after which I was forced to\nswim till I got up to it.

The seamen threw me the end of the cord, which I\nfastened to a hole in the fore-part of the boat, and the other end to a man of\nwar; but I found all my labour to little purpose; for, being out of my depth, I\nwas not able to work. In this necessity I was forced to swim behind, and\npush the boat forward, as often as I could, with one of my hands; and the\ntide favouring me, I advanced so far that I could just hold up my chin and\nfeel the ground. I rested two or three minutes, and then gave the boat\nanother shove, and so on, till the sea was no higher than my arm-pits; and\nnow, the most laborious part being over, I took out my other cables, which\nwere stowed in one of the ships, and fastened them first to the boat, and\nthen to nine of the vessels whic h attended me; the wind being  favourable,\nthe seamen towed, and I shoved, until we arrived within forty yards of the\nshore; and",

I told the\nemperor “that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way, to carry me\nto some place whence I might return into my native country; and begged his\nmajesty’ s orders for getting materials to fit it up, together with his license to\ndepart;” which, after some kind expostulations, he was pleased t",

But I was\nafterward given privately to understand, that his imperial majesty , never\nimagining I had the least notice  of his designs, believed I was only gone to\nBlefuscu in performance of my promise, according to the license he had\ngiven me, which  was well known at our court, and would return in a few\ndays, when the ceremony was ended. But he was at last in pain at my long\nabsence; and after consulting with the treasurer and the rest of that cabal, a\nperson of qualit y was dispatched with the copy of the articles against me.\nThis envoy had instructions to represent to the monarch of Blefuscu, “the\ngreat lenity of his master , who was content to",

He said, “that as for\nsending me bound, his brother knew it was impossible; that, although I had\ndeprived him of his fleet, yet he owed great obligations to me for many\ngood offices I had done him in making the peace.

Five hundred work men were employed to make two sails to\nmy boat, according to my directions, by quilting thirteen folds of their\nstrongest linen together .

A great\nstone that I happened to find, after a long search, by the sea-sh ore, served\nme for an anchor . I had the tallow of three hundred cows, for greasing my\nboat, and other uses. I was at incredible pains in cutting down some of the\nlargest timber -trees, for oars and masts, wherein I was, however, much\nassisted by his majesty’ s ship-carpenters, who helped me in smoothing\nthem, after I had done the rough work.\nIn about a mont h, when all was prepared, I sent to receive his majesty’ s\ncommands, and to take my leave. The emperor and royal family came out\nof the palace; I lay down on my face to kiss his hand, which he very\ngraciously gave me: so did the empress and young princes of the blood.

The\nship slackened her sails, and I came up with her between five and six in the\nevening, Septem ber 26th; but my heart leaped within me to see her English\ncolours. I put my cows and sheep into my coat-pockets, and got on board\nwith all my little cargo of provisions. The vessel was an English\nmerchantman, returning from Japan by the North and South seas; the\ncaptain, Mr. John Biddel, of Deptford, a very civil man, and an excellent\nsailor .\nWe were now in the latitude of 30 degrees south; there were about fifty\nmen in the ship; and here I met an old comrade of mine, one Peter Williams,\nwho gave me a good character to the captain.

I had only one misfortune, that the rats on board\ncarried away one of my sheep; I found her bones in a hole, picked clean\nfrom the flesh. The rest of my cattle I got safe ashore, and set them a-\ngrazing in a bowling-green at Greenwich, where the fineness of the grass\nmade them feed very heartily , though I had always feared the contrary:\nneither could I possibly have preserved them in so long a voyage, if the\ncaptain had not allowed me some of his best biscuit, which, rubbed to\npowder , and mingled with wate r, was their constant food. The short time I\ncontinued in England, I made a considerable profit by showing my cattle to\nmany persons of quality and others: and before I began my second voyage,\nI sold them for six hundred pounds.

My eldest uncle John had left me\nan estate in land, near Epping, of about thirty pounds a year; and I had a\nlong lease of the Black Bull in Fetter Lane, which yielded me as much\nmore; so that I was not in any danger of leaving my family upon  the parish.\nMy son Johnny , named so after his uncle, was at the grammar school, and a\ntowardly child.

We\nhad a very prosp erous gale, till we arrived at the Cape of Good Hope, where\nwe landed for fresh water; but discovering a leak, we unshipped our goods\nand wintered there; for the captain falling sick of an ague, we could not\nleave the Cape till the end of March. We then set sail, and had a good\nvoyage till we passed the Straits of Madagascar; but having got northward\nof that island, and to about five degrees south latitude, the wind s, which in\nthose seas are observed to blow a constant equal gale between the north and\nwest, from the beginning of December to the beginning of May, on the 19th\nof April began to blow with much greater violence, and more westerly than\nusual, continuing so for twenty days togethe",

But he, being a man well experienced in\nthe navigation of those seas, bid us all prepare against a storm, which\naccordingly happened the day following: for the southern wind, called the\nsouthern monsoon, began to set in.\nFinding it was likely to overblo w, we took in our sprit-sail, and stood by\nto hand the fore-sail; but making foul weather , we looked the guns were all\nfast, and handed the mizen.

We reefed the fore-sail and set him, and hauled aft the fore-sheet; the helm was hard a-weather .\nThe ship wore bravely . We belayed the fore down-haul; but the sail was\nsplit, and we hauled down the yard, and got the sail into the ship, and\nunbound all the things clear of it. It was a very fierce storm; the sea broke\nstrange and dangerous. We hauled off upon the laniard of the whip-staf f,\nand helped the man at the helm. We would not get down our topmast, but let\nall stand, because she scudded before the sea very well, and we knew that\nthe top-mast being aloft, the ship was the wholesomer , and made better way\nthrough the sea, seeing we had sea-room. When the storm was over, we set\nfore-sail and main-sail, and brought the ship to. Then we set the mizen,\nmain-top-sail, and the fore-top-sail. Our co",

We\nthought it best to hold on the same course, rather than turn more northerly ,\nwhich might have brought us to the north-west part of Great Tartary , and\ninto the Frozen Sea.\nOn the 16th day of June, 1703, a boy on the top-mast discovered  land. On\nthe 17th, we came in full view of a great island, or continent (for we knew\nnot whether;) on the south side whereof was a small neck of land jutting out\ninto the sea, and a creek too shallow to hold a ship of above one hundred\ntons. We cast anchor within a league of this creek, and our captain sent a\ndozen of his men well armed in the long-boat, with vessels for water, if any\ncould be found. I desired his leave to go with them, that I might see the\ncountry , and make what discoveries I could. When we came to land we saw\nno river or sprin g, nor any sign of inhabitants.

Our men therefore wandered\non the shore to find out some fresh water near the sea, and I walked alone\nabout a mile on the other side, where I observed the country all barren and\nrocky . I now began to be weary, and seeing nothing to entertain my\ncuriosity , I returned gently down  towards the creek; and the sea being full inmy view , I saw our men already got into the boat, and rowing for life to the\nship. I was going to holla after them, although it had been to little purpose,\nwhen I observed a huge creature walking after them in the sea, as fast as he\ncould: he waded not much deeper than his knees, and took prodigious\nstrides: but our men had the start of him half a league, and, the sea\nthereabouts being full of sharp-pointed rocks, the monster was not able to\novertake the boat.

This I was afterwards told, for I durst not stay to see the\nissue of the adventure; but ran as fast as I could the way I first went, and\nthen climbed up a steep hill, which gave me some prospect of the country . I\nfound it fully cultivated; but that which first surprised me was the length of\nthe grass, which, in those grounds that seemed to be kept for hay, was about\ntwenty feet high.\nI fell into a high road, for so I took it to be, though it served to the\ninhabitants only as a foot-path through a field of barley . Here I walked on\nfor some  time, but could see little on either side, it being now near harvest,\nand the corn rising at least forty feet. I was an hour walking to the end of\nthis field, which was fenced in with a hedge of at least one hundred and\ntwenty feet high, and the trees so lofty that I could make no computation of\ntheir altitude. There was a sti",

There was a stile to pass from this field into the next. It had\nfour steps, and a stone to cross over when you came to the uppermost. It\nwas impossible for me to climb this stile, because every step was six-feet\nhigh, and the upper stone about twenty . I was endeavouring to find some\ngap in the hedge, when I discovered one of the inhabitants in the next field,\nadvancing towards the stile, of the same size with him whom I saw in the\nsea pursuing our boat. He appeared as tall as an ordinary spire steeple, and\ntook about ten yards at every stride, as near as I could guess. I was struck\nwith the utmost fear and astonis hment, and ran to hide myself in the corn,\nwhence I saw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next field on\nthe right hand, and heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than a",

Whereupon seven monsters, like himself,\ncame towards him with reaping-hooks in their hands, each hook about the\nlargeness of six scythes. These people were not so well clad as the first,\nwhose servants or labourers they seemed to be; for, upon some words he\nspoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I lay. I kept from them\nat as great a distance as I could, but was forced to move with extreme\ndifficulty , for the stalks of the corn were sometimes not above a foot distant,so that I could hardly squeeze my body betwixt them.

Here it was impossible for me to advance a step;\nfor the stalks were so interwoven, that I could not creep through, and the\nbeards of the fallen ears so strong and pointed, that they pierced  through my\nclothes into my flesh. At the same time I heard the reapers not a hundred\nyards behind me. Being quite dispirited with toil, and wholly overcome by\ngrief and dispai r, I lay down between two ridges, and hearti ly wished I\nmight there end my days. I bemoaned my desolate widow and fatherless\nchildren. I lamented my own folly and wilfulness, in attemptin g a second\nvoyage, against the advice of all my friends and relations.

In this terrible\nagitation of mind, I could not forbear thinking of Lilliput, whose inhabitants\nlooked upon me as the greates t prodigy that ever appeared in the world;\nwhere I was able to draw an imperial fleet in my hand, and perform those\nother actions, which will be recorded for ever in the chronicles of that\nempire, while posterity shall hardly believe them, although attested by\nmillions. I reflected what a mortification it must prove to me, to appear as\ninconsiderable in this nation, as one single Lilliputian would be among us.\nBut this I conce ived was to be the least of my misfortunes; for, as human\ncreatures are observed to be more savage and cruel in proportion to their\nbulk, what could I expect but to be a morsel in the mouth of the first among\nthese enormous barbarians that should happen to seize me? Undoubtedly\nphilosophers are in the right, when they tell us that nothing is great or little\notherwise than by comparison. It might have pleased fortune, to have let the\nLill",

And who knows but that even this\nprodigious race of mortals might be equally overmatched in some distant\npart of the world, whereof we have yet no discovery .\nScared and confounded as I was, I could not forbear going on with these\nreflections, when one of the reapers, approaching within ten yards of the\nridge where I lay, made me apprehend that with the next step I should be\nsquashed to death under his foot, or cut in two with his reaping -hook. And\ntherefore, when he was again about to move, I screamed as loud as fear\ncould make me: whereupon the huge creature trod short, and, looking round\nabout under him for some time, at last espied me as I lay on the ground.

I walked with intrepidity five or\nsix times before the very head of the cat, and came within half a yard of her;whereupon she drew herself back, as if she were more afraid of me: I had\nless apprehension concerning the dogs, whereof three or four came into the\nroom, as it is usual in farmers’  houses; one of which was a mast iff, equal in\nbulk to four elephants, and another a greyhound, somewhat taller than the\nmastif f, but not so lar ge.\nWhen dinner was almost done, the nurse came in with a child of a year\nold in her arms, who immediat ely spied me, and began a ",

This made me reflect upon the fair skins\nof our English ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they are\nof our own size, and their defec ts not to be seen but through a magnifying\nglass; where we find by experiment that the smoothest and whitest skins\nlook rough, and coarse, and ill-coloured.\nI remember when I was at Lilliput, th",

He said, “he could discover great holes in my skin; that the\nstumps of my beard were ten times stronger than the bristles of a boar, and\nmy complexion made up of several colours altogether disagreeable:”although I must beg leave to say for myself, that I am as fair as most of my\nsex and country , and very little sunburnt by all my travels.

On the other\nside, discoursing of the ladies in that emperor ’s court, he used to tell me,\n“one had freckles; another too wide a mouth; a third too large a nose;”\nnothing of which I was able to distinguish. I confess this reflection was\nobvious enough; which, howeve r, I could not forbear , lest the reader might\nthink those vast creatures were actually deformed: for I must do them the\njustice to say, they are a comely race of people, and particularly  the features\nof my master ’s countenance, although he was but a farmer , when I beheld\nhim from the height of sixty feet, appeared very well proportioned.\nWhen dinner was done, my master went out to his labourers, and, as I\ncould discover by his voice and gesture, gave his wife strict charge to take\ncare of me.

I was very much tired, and disposed to sleep, which my mistress\nperceiving, she put me on her own bed, and covered me with a clean white\nhandkerchief, but lar ger and coarser than the mainsail of a man of war .\nI slept about two hours, and dreamt I was at home with my wife and\nchildren, which aggravated my sorrows when I awaked, and found myself\nalone in a vast room, between two and three hundred feet wide , and above\ntwo hundred high, lying in a bed twenty yards wide. My mistre ss was gone\nabout her household affairs, and had locked me in. The bed was eight yards\nfrom the floor .

While I was under these circumstances, two\nrats crept up the curtains, and ran smelling backwards and forwards on the\nbed. One of them  came up almost to my face, whereupon I rose in a fright,\nand drew out my hanger to defend myself. These horrible animals had the\nboldness to attack me on both sides, and one of them held his forefeet at my\ncollar; but I had the good fortune to rip up his belly before he could do me\nany mischief. He fell down at my feet; and the other , seeing the fate of his\ncomrade, made his escape, but not without one good wound on the back,\nwhich I gave him as he fled, and made the blood run trickling  from him.\nAfter this exploit, I walked gently to and fro on the bed, to recover my\nbreath and loss of spirits.

I measured the tail of the dead rat, and found it to be two yardslong, wanting an inch; but it went against my stomach to drag the carcass\noff the bed, where it lay still bleeding; I observed it had yet some life, but\nwith a strong slash across the neck, I thoroughly despatched it.\nSoon after my mistress came into the room, who seeing me all bloody ,\nran and took me up in her hand.

The good woman, with much\ndifficulty , at last perceived what I would be at, and taking me up again in\nher hand, walked into the garden, where she set me down.

This young girl\nwas so handy , that after I had once or twice pulled off my clothes before\nher, she was able to dress and undress me, though I never gave her that\ntrouble when she would let me do either myself. She made me seven shirts,\nand some other linen, of as fine cloth as could be got, which indeed was\ncoarser than sackcloth; and these she constantly washed for me with her\nown hands. She was likewise my school-mistress, to teach me the language:\nwhen I pointed to any thing, she told me the name of it in her own tongue,\nso that in a few days I was able to call for whatever I had a mind to. She\nwas very good- natured, and not above forty feet high, being little for her\nage. She gave me the name of Grildrig , which the family took up, and\nafterwards the whole kingdom .

Another farmer , who lived hard by,\nand was a particular friend of my master , came on a visit on purpose to\ninquire into the truth of this story. I was immediately produced, and placed\nupon a table, where I walked as I was commanded, drew my hanger , put it\nup again, made my reverence to my master ’s guest, asked him in his own\nlanguage how he did, and told him he was welcome , just as my little nurse\nhad instructed me.

Our people, who discovered the cause of my mirth, bore me\ncompany in laughing, at which the old fellow was fool enough  to be angry\nand out of countenance. He had the character of a great miser; and, to my\nmisfortune, he well deserved it, by the cursed advice he gave my master , to\nshow me as a sight upon a mark et-day in the next town, which was half an\nhour’s riding, about two-and-twenty miles from our house.

The poor girl laid me on her bosom,\nand fell a weeping with shame and grief. She apprehended some mischief\nwould happen to me from rude vulgar folks, who might squeeze me to\ndeath, or break one of my limbs  by taking me in their hands. She had also\nobserved how modest I was in my nature, how nicely I regarded  my honour ,\nand what an indignity I should conceive it, to be exposed for money as a\npublic spectacle , to the meane st of the people. She said, her papa and\nmamma had promised that Grild rig should be hers; but now she found they\nmeant to serve her as they did last year, when they pretended to give her a\nlamb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, sold it to a butcher .

The box was close on\nevery side, with a little door for me to go in and out, and a few gimlet holes\nto let in air.

Our journey was somewhat farther than from London to St.\nAlban’ s. My master alighted at an inn which he used to frequen t; and after\nconsulting a while with the inn-keeper , and making some necessary\npreparations, he hired the grultrud , or crier, to give notice through the town\nof a strange creature to be seen at the sign of the Green Eagle, not so big as\na splacnuck  (an animal in that country very finely shaped, about six feet\nlong,) and in every part of the body resembling a human creature, could\nspeak several words, and perform a hundred diverting tricks.\nI ",

My little nurse stood on a low stool close to\nthe table , to take care of me, and direct what I should do. My master , to\navoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty people at a time to see me.

It was at least three days before I\nrecovered my strength; and that I might have no rest at home, all the\nneighbouring gentlemen from a hundred miles round, hearing of my fame,\ncame to see me at my master ’s own house.

The\ngirl had lined it on all sides with the softest cloth she could get, well quilted\nunderneath, furnished it with her baby’ s bed, provided me with linen and\nother necessaries, and made everything as convenient as she could. We had\nno other company but a boy of the house, who rode after us with the\nluggage.\nMy master’s design was to show me in all the towns by the way, and to\nstep out of the road for fifty or a hundred miles, to any village, or person of\nquality’ s house, where he might  expect custom. We made easy journeys, ofnot above seven or eight score miles a day; for Glumdalclitch, on purpose\nto spare  me, complained she was tired with the trotting of the horse.

We passed over\nfive or six rivers, many degrees broader and deeper than the Nile or the\nGanges: and there was hardly a rivulet so small as the Thames at London\nBridge. We were ten weeks in our journey , and I was shown in eighteen\nlarge towns, besides many villages, and private families.\nOn the 26th day of October we arrived at the metropolis, called in their\nlanguage Lorbrulgrud , or Pride of the Universe.

She made me some\ngeneral questions about my country and my travels, which I answered as\ndistinctly , and in as few words as I could.

That my health was much impaired, by the continual drudgery of\nentertaining the rabble every hour of the day; and that, if my master had not\nthought my life in danger , her majesty would not have got so cheap a\nbargain.

She took me in her own hand, and carried me to the king, who was\nthen retired to his cabinet.

They observed by my teeth, which they viewed\nwith great exactness, that I was a carnivorous animal; yet most  quadrupeds\nbeing an overmatch for me, and field mice, with some others, too nimble,\nthey could not imagine how I should be able to support myself, unless I fed\nupon snails and other insects, which they offered, by many learned\narguments, to evince that I could not possibly do.

They would not allow me to be a dwarf, because my littleness was\nbeyond all degrees of compari son; for the queen’ s favourite dwarf, the\nsmallest ever known in that kingdom, was near thirty feet high. After much\ndebate, they concluded unanim ously , that I was only relplum scalcath ,\nwhich is interpreted literally lusus naturæ ; a determination exactly\nagreeable to the modern philosophy of Europe, whose professors,\ndisdaining the old evasion of occult causes, whereby the followers of\nAristotle endeavoured in vain to disguise their ignorance, have invented this\nwonderful solution of all difficulties, to the unspeakable advancement of\nhuman knowledge.\nAfter this decis",

    " The king, who had a much better understanding,\ndismissing his learned men, sent for the farmer , who by good fortune was\nnot yet gone out of town. Having therefore first examined him privately ,\nand then confronted him with me and the young girl, his majesty began to\nthink that what we told him might possibly be true. He desired the queen to\norder that a particular care shou ld be taken of me; and was of opinion that\nGlumdalclitch should still continue in her office of tending me, because he\nobserved we had a great affection for each other . A convenient apartment\nwas provided for her at court: she had a sort of governess appoi nted to take\ncare of her education, a maid to dress her, and two other servants for menial\noffices; but the care of me was wholly appropriated to herself.

This man was a most ingenious artist, and according to my direction,\nin three weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen feet square,\nand twelve high, with sash-windows, a door, and two closets, like a London\nbed-chamber . The board, that made the ceiling, was to be lifted up and\ndown by two hinges, to put in a bed ready furnished by her majesty’ supholsterer , which Glumdalclitc h took out every day to air, made it with her\nown hands, and letting it down at night, locked up the roof over me. A nice\nworkman, who was famous for little curiosities, undertook to make me two\nchairs, with backs and frames, of a substance not unlike ivory , and two\ntables, with a cabinet to put my things in.

The smith, after several attempts, made the smallest that\never was seen among them, for I have known a larger at the gate of a\ngentleman’ s house in England. I made a shift to keep the key in a pocket of\nmy own, fearing Glumdalclitch  might lose it. The queen likewise ordered\nthe thinn est silks that could be gotten, to make me clothes, not much thicker\nthan an English  blanket, very cumbersome till I was accustom ed to them.\nThey were after the fashion of the kingdom, partly resembling the Persian,\nand partly the Chinese, and are a very grave and decent habit.\nThe queen became so fond of my company , that she could not dine\nwithout me.

Her majesty used to put a bit of meat upon one of my\ndishes, out of which I carved for myself, and her diversion was to see me\neat in miniature: for the queen (who had indeed but a weak stomach) took\nup, at one mouthful, as much as a dozen English farmers could eat at a\nmeal, which to me was for some time a very nauseous sight.  She would\ncraunch the wing of a lark, bones and all, between her teeth,  although it\nwere nine times as large as that of a full-grown turkey; and put a bit of\nbread into her mouth as big as two twelve-penny loaves. She drank out of a\ngolden cup, above a hogshead at a draught. Her knives were twice as long\nas a scythe, set straight upon the handle. The spoons, forks, and other\ninstruments, were all in the same proportion.

But I confess,  that, after I\nhad been a little too copious in talking of my own beloved country , of our\ntrade and wars by sea and land, of our schisms in religion, and parties in the\nstate; the prejud ices of his education prevailed so far, that he could not\nforbear taking me up in his right hand, and stroking me gently with the\nother , after a hearty fit of laughing, asked me, “whether I was a whig or\ntory?” Then turning to his first minister , who waited behind him with a\nwhite staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he\nobserved “how contemptible a thing was human grandeur , which could be\nmimicked by such diminutive insects as I: and yet,” says he, “I dare engage\nthese creatures have their titles and distinctions of honour; they contrive\nlittle nests and burrows, that they call houses and cities; they make a figure\nin dress and equipage; they love, they fight,",
    "these creatures have their titles and distinctions of honour; they contrive\nlittle nests and burrows, that they call houses and cities; they make a figure\nin dress and equipage; they love, they fight, they dispute, they cheat, they\nbetray!” And thus he continued on, while my colour came and went several\ntimes, with indignation, to hear our noble country , the mistress  of arts and\narms, the scour ge of France, the arbitress of Europe, the seat of virtue, piety ,\nhonour , and truth, the pride and envy of the world, so contemptuously\ntreated.\nBut as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so upon mature thoughts\nI began to doubt whether I was injured or no. For, after having been\naccustomed several months to the sight and converse of this people, and\nobserved every object upon which I cast my eyes to be of proportionable\nmagnitude, the horror I had at first conceived from their bulk and aspect\nwas so far worn off, that if I had then beheld a company of English lords\nand ladies in th",

Neither , indeed, could I forbea r smiling at\nmyself, when the queen used to place me upon her hand towards a looking-\nglass, by which both our persons appeared before me in full view together;\nand there could be nothing more ridiculous than the compariso n; so that I\nreally began to imagine myself  dwindled many degrees below my usual\nsize.\nNothing angered and mortified me so much as the queen’ s dwarf; who\nbeing of the lowest stature that was ever in that country (for I verily think\nhe was not full thirty feet high), became so insolent at seeing ",

But my little nurse ran\nto my relief, and took me out, after I had swallowed above a quart of cream.\nI was put to bed: however , I received no other damage than the loss of a suit\nof clothes, which was utterly spoiled. The dwarf was soundly whipt, and as\na farther punishment, forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which he\nhad thrown me: neither was he ever restored to favour; for soon after the\nqueen bestowed him on a lady of high quality , so that I saw him no more, to\nmy very great satisfaction; for I could not tell to what extremities such a\nmalicious urchi",

The dwarf, at my entreaty , had no\nother punishment than a sound whipping.\nI was frequently rallied by the queen upon account of my fearfulness; and\nshe used to ask me whether the people of my country were as great cowards\nas myself? The occasion was this: the kingdom is much pestered with flies\nin summer; and these odious insects, each of them as big as a Dunstable\nlark, hardly gave me any rest while I sat at dinner , with their continual\nhumming and buzzing about mine ears.

I had much ado to defend myself against\nthese detestable animals, and could not forbear starting when they came on\nmy face.

The whole extent\nof this prince’ s dominions reach es about six thousand miles in length, and\nfrom three to five in breadth: whence I cannot but conclude, that our\ngeographers of Europe are in a great error , by supposing nothing but sea\nbetween Japan and California; for it was ever my opinion, that there must\nbe a balance of earth to counte rpoise the great continent of Tartary; and\ntherefore they ought to correct their maps and charts, by joining this vast\ntract of land to the north-west parts of America, wherein I shall be ready to\nlend them my assistance.\nThe kingdom is a peninsula, terminated to the north-east by a ridge of\nmountains thirty  miles high, which are altogether impassabl",

There is not one\nseaport in the whole kingdom: and those parts of the coasts into which the\nrivers issue, are so full of pointed rocks, and the sea generally so rough, that\nthere is no venturing with the smallest of their boats; so that these people\nare wholly excluded from any commerce with the rest of the world. But the\nlarge rivers are full of vessels, and abound with excellent fish; for they\nseldom get any from the sea, because the sea fish are of the same size with\nthose in Europe, and consequently not worth catching; whereby it is\nmanifest, that nature, in the produ",

However , now and then they\ntake a whale that happens to be dashed against the rocks, which the\ncommon people feed on heartily . These whales I have known so large, that a\nman could hardly carry one upon his shoulders; and sometimes, for\ncuriosity , they are brought in hampers to Lorbrulgrud; I saw one of them in\na dish at the king’ s table, which passed for a rarity , but I did not observe he\nwas fond of it; for I think, indeed, the bigness disgusted him, although I\nhave seen one somewhat lar ger in Greenland.\nThe country is well inhabited, for it contains fifty-one cities, near a\nhundred walled towns, and a great number of villages.

To satisfy my\ncurious reader , it may be sufficient to describe Lorbrulgrud. This city stands\nupon almost two equal parts, on each side the river that passes through. It\ncontains above eighty thousand  houses, and about six hundred thousand\ninhabitants. It is in length three  glomglungs  (which make about fifty-four\nEnglish miles,) and two and a half in breadth; as I measured it myself in the\nroyal map made by the king’ s order , which was laid on the ground on\npurpose for me, and extended a hundred feet: I paced the diameter and\ncircumference several times barefoot, and, computing by the scale,\nmeasured it pretty exactly .\nThe king’s palace is no regular  edifice, but a heap of buildings, about\nseven miles round: the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty feet\nhigh, and broad and ",

A coach was allowed to\nGlumdalclitch and me, wherein her governess frequently took her out to see\nthe town, or go among the shops; and I was always of the party, carried in\nmy box; although the girl, at my own desire, would often take me out, and\nhold me in her hand, that I might more conveniently view the houses and\nthe people, as we passed along the streets. I reckoned our coach to be about\na square  of Westminster -hall, but not altogether so high: howev er, I cannot\nbe very exact.

There was a fellow with a\nwen in his neck , larger than five wool-packs; and another , with a couple of\nwooden legs, each about twenty  feet high. But the most hateful sight of all,was the lice crawling on their clothes.

This travelling-closet\nwas an exact square, with a window in the middle of three of the squares,\nand each window was latticed with iron wire on the outside, to prevent\naccidents in long journeys. On the fourth side, which had no window , two\nstrong staples were fixed, through which the person that carried  me, when I\nhad a mind to be on horseback, put a leathern belt, and buckled it about his\nwaist.

In journeys, when I was weary of the coach, a servant on\nhorseback would buckle on my box, and place it upon a cushion before\nhim; and there I had a full prospect of the country on three sides, from my\nthree windows.

The\nexecution of a criminal. The author shows his skill in\nnavigation.\nI should have lived happy enough in that country , if my littleness had not\nexposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents; some of which\nI shall venture to relate. Glumdalclitch often carried me into the gardens of\nthe court in my smaller box, and would sometimes take me out of it, and\nhold me in her hand, or set me down to walk. I remember , before the dwarf\nleft the queen, he followed us one day into those gardens, and my nurse\nhaving set me down, he and I being close together , near some dwarf apple\ntrees, I must needs show my wit, by a silly allusion between him and the\ntrees, which happens to hold in their language as it does in ours",
    "e down, he and I being close together , near some dwarf apple\ntrees, I must needs show my wit, by a silly allusion between him and the\ntrees, which happens to hold in their language as it does in ours.\nWhereupon, the malicious rogue, watching his opportunity , when I was\nwalking under one of them, shook it directly over my head, by which a\ndozen apples, each of them near as large as a Bristol barrel, came tumbling\nabout my ears; one of them hit me on the back as I chanced to stoop, and\nknocked me down flat on my face; but I received no other hurt, and the\ndwarf was pardoned at my desire, because I had given the provocation.\nAnother day, Glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass-plot to divert\nmyself, while she walked at some distance with her governess. In the\nmeantime, there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail, that I was\nimmediately , by the force of it, struck to the ground: and when I was down,\nthe hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body , as if I had been\npelte",
    "uch a violent shower of hail, that I was\nimmediately , by the force of it, struck to the ground: and when I was down,\nthe hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body , as if I had been\npelted with tennis-balls; however , I made a shift to creep on all fours, and\nshelter myself, by lying flat on my face, on the lee-side of a border of\nlemon-thyme, but so bruised from head to foot, that I could not go abroad in\nten days. Neithe r is this at all to be wondered at, because nature, in that\ncountry , observ ing the same proportion through all her operations, a\nhailstone is near eighteen hundr ed times as large as one in Europe; which Ican assert upon experience, having been so curious as to weigh and measure\nthem.\nBut a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden, when\nmy little nurse, believing she had put me in a secure place (which I often\nentreated her to do, that I might enjoy my own thoughts,) and having left\nmy box at home , to avoid the trouble of carrying it,",
    " little nurse, believing she had put me in a secure place (which I often\nentreated her to do, that I might enjoy my own thoughts,) and having left\nmy box at home , to avoid the trouble of carrying it, went to another part of\nthe garden with her governess and some ladies of her acquaintance. While\nshe was absent, and out of hearing, a small white spaniel that belonged to\none of the chief gardeners, having got by accident into the garden,\nhappened to range near the place where I lay: the dog, following the scent,\ncame directly up, and taking me in his mouth, ran straight to his master\nwagging his tail, and set me gently on the ground. By good fortune he had\nbeen so well taught, that I was carried between his teeth without the least\nhurt, or even tearing my clothes . But the poor gardener , who knew me well,\nand had a great kindness for me, was in a terrible fright: he gently took me\nup in both his hands, and asked me how I did? but I was so amazed and out\nof breath, that I could not spea",

In a few minutes I came to myself,\nand he carried me safe to my little nurse, who, by this time, had returned to\nthe place where she left me, and was in cruel agonies when I did not appear ,\nnor answer when she called. She severely reprimanded the gardener on\naccount of his dog. But the thing  was hushed up, and never known at court,\nfor the girl was afraid of the queen’ s anger; and truly, as to myse lf, I thought\nit would not be for my reputation, that such a story should go about.\nThis accident absolutely determined Glumdalclitch never to trust me\nabroad for the future out of her sight. I had been long afraid of this\nresolution, and therefore concea led from her some little unlucky adventures,\nthat happened in those times when I was left by myself. Once a kite,\nhovering over t",
    "sight. I had been long afraid of this\nresolution, and therefore concea led from her some little unlucky adventures,\nthat happened in those times when I was left by myself. Once a kite,\nhovering over the garden, made a stoop at me, and if I had not resolutely\ndrawn my hang er, and run unde r a thick espalier , he would have certainly\ncarried me away  in his talons. Another time, walking to the top of a fresh\nmole-hill, I fell to my neck in the hole, through which that anim al had cast\nup the earth, and coined some lie, not worth remembering, to excuse myself\nfor spoiling my clothes. I likewi se broke my right shin against the shell of a\nsnail, which I happened to stumble over, as I was walking alone and\nthinking on poor England.I cannot tell whether I were more pleased or mortified to observe, in\nthose solitary walks, that the smaller birds did not appear to be at all afraid\nof me, but would  hop about within a yard’ s distance, looking for worms and\nother food, with as much indifferenc",

I remember , a thrush had the confidence to snatch out of\nmy hand , with his bill, a piece of cake that Glumdalclitch had just given me\nfor my breakfas t. When I attemp ted to catch any of these birds, they would\nboldly turn against me, endeavouring to peck my fingers, which  I durst not\nventure within their reach; and then they would hop back unconcerned, to\nhunt for worms or snails, as they did before. But one day, I took a thick\ncudgel, and threw it with all my strength so luckily , at a linnet, that I\nknocked him down, and seizing  him by the neck with both my hands, ran\nwith him in triumph to my nurse.

However , the bird, who had only been\nstunned, recovering himself gave me so many boxes with his wings, on\nboth sides of my head and body , though I held him at arm’s length, and was\nout of the reach of his claws, that I was twenty times thinking to let him go.\nBut I was soon relieved by one of our servants, who wrung off the bird’ s\nneck, and I had him next day for dinner , by the queen’ s command. This\nlinnet, as near as I can remember , seemed to be somewhat larger than an\nEnglish swan.\nThe maids of honour often invited Glumdalclitch to their apartments, and\ndesired she would bring me along with her, on purpose to have the pleasure\nof seeing and touching me. They would often strip me naked from top to\ntoe, and lay me at full length in their bosoms; wherewith I was much\ndisgusted becau se, to say the truth, a very offensive smell came from their\nskins; which I do not mention, or intend, to the disadvantage of thos",

And, after all,\nI found their natural smell was much more supportable, than when they\nused perfumes, under which I immediately swooned away . I cannot forget,\nthat an intimate friend of mine in Lilliput, took the freedom in a warm day,\nwhen I had used a good deal of exercise, to complain of a strong smell\nabout me, although I am as little faulty that way, as most of my sex: but I\nsuppose his faculty of smelling was as nice with regard to me, as mine was\nto that of this people.

Upon this point, I cannot forbear doing justice to thequeen my mistress, and Glumdalclitch my nurse, whose persons were as\nsweet as those of any lady in England.\nThat which gave me most uneasiness among these maids of honour\n(when my nurse  carried me to visit them) was, to see them use me without\nany manner of ceremony , like a creature who had no sort of consequence:\nfor they would strip themselves  to the skin, and put on their smocks in my\npresence, while  I was placed on their toilet, directly before their naked\nbodies, which I am sure to me was very far from being a tempting sight, or\nfrom giving me any other emot ions than those of horror and disgust: their\nskins appeared so coarse and uneven, so variously coloured, when I saw\nthem near, with a mole here and there as broad as a trenche r, and hairs\nhanging from",

Neithe r did they at all scruple, while I was by, to\ndischar ge what they had drank, to the quantity of at least two hogsheads, in\na vessel that held above three tuns. The handsomest among these maids of\nhonour , a pleasant, frolicsome girl of sixteen, would sometimes set me\nastride upon one of her nipples, with many other tricks, wherein the reader\nwill excuse me for not being over particular . But I was so much  displeased,\nthat I entreated Glumdalclitch to contrive some excuse for not seeing that\nyoung lady any more.\nOne day, a youn g gentleman, who was nephew to my nurse’ s governess,\ncame and pressed them both to see an execution.

It was of a man, who had\nmurdered one of that gentleman’ s intimate acquaintance. Glumdalclitch was\nprevailed on to be of the comp any, very much against her inclination, for\nshe was naturally tender -hearte d: and, as for myself, although I abhorred\nsuch kind of spectacles, yet my curiosity tempted me to see something that I\nthought must be extraordinary . The malefactor was fixed in a chair upon a\nscaffold erected  for that purpose, and his head cut off at one blow , with a\nsword of about forty feet long. The veins and arteries spouted up such a\nprodigious quan tity of blood, and so high in the air, that the great jet d’eau\nat Versailles was not equal to it for the time it lasted: and the head, when it\nfell on the scaffold floor , gave such a bounce as made me start, although I\nwas at least half an English mile distant.\nThe queen, who often used to he",

I answered, that I\nunderstood both very well: for although my proper employment had been to\nbe surgeon or doctor to the ship, yet often, upon a pinch, I was forced to\nwork like a common mariner . But I could not see how this could be done in\ntheir country , where the smallest wherry was equal to a first-rate man of war\namong us; and such a boat as I could manage would never live in any of\ntheir rivers.

Whe n it was finishe d, the queen was so delighted, that she ran\nwith it in her lap to the king, who ordered it to be put into a cistern full of\nwater , with me in it, by way of trial, where I could not mana ge my two\nsculls, or little oars, for want of room. But the queen had before contrived\nanother project. She ordered the joiner to make a wooden trough of three\nhundred feet long, fifty broad, and eight deep; which, being well pitched, to\nprevent leaking,  was placed on the floor , along the wall, in an outer room of\nthe palace.

It had a cock near the bottom to let out the water , when it began\nto grow stale; and two servants could easily fill it in half an hour. Here I\noften used to row for my own diversion, as well as that of the queen and her\nladies, who thought themselves  well entertained with my skill and agility .\nSometimes I would put up my sail, and then my business was only to steer,\nwhile the ladies gave me a gale with their fans; and, when they were weary ,\nsome of their pages would blow  my sail forward with their breath, while I\nshowed my art by steering starboard or larboard as I pleased. When I had\ndone, Glumdalc litch always carried back my boat into her closet, and hung\nit on a nail to dry .\nIn this exercise I once met an accident, which had like to have cost me\nmy life; for, one of the pages  having put my boat into the trough, the\ngoverness who attended Glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up, to\nplace me in the boat: but ",

When the frog was got in, it hopped at once\nhalf the length of the boat, and then over my head, backward and forward,\ndaubing my face and clothes with its odious slime. The largeness of its\nfeatures made it appear the most deformed animal that can be conceived.\nHowever , I desired Glumdalclitc h to let me deal with it alone. I banged it a\ngood while with one of my sculls, and at last forced it to leap out of the\nboat.\nBut the greatest  danger I ever underwent in that kingdom, was from a\nmonkey , who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen.

He took\nme up in his right fore-foot and held me as a nurse does a child she is going\nto suckle, just as I have seen the same sort of creature do with a kitten in\nEurope; and when I offered to struggle he squeezed me so hard, that I\nthought it more prudent to subm it. I have good reason to believe, that he\ntook me for a young one of his own species, by his often strok ing my face\nvery gently with his other paw.

I heard\nGlumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying me out. The\npoor girl was almost distracted : that quarter of the palace was all in an\nuproar; the servants ran for ladders; the monkey was seen by hundreds in\nthe court, sitting upon the ridge of a building, holding me like a baby in one\nof his forepaws, and feeding me with the other , by cramming into my\nmouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag on one side of his\nchaps, and patting me when I would not eat; whereat many of the rabble\nbelow could not forbear laughing; neither do I think they justly ought to be\nblamed, for, without qu",

Some of the people threw up stones, hoping to drive the\nmonkey down; but this was strictly forbidden, or else, very probably , my\nbrains had been dashed out.\nThe ladders were now applied, and mounted by several men; which the\nmonkey observing, and finding himself almost encompassed, not being able\nto make speed enough with his three legs, let me drop on a ridge tile, and\nmade his escape. Here I sat for some time, five hundred yards from the\nground, expectin g every moment to be blown down by the wind, or to fall\nby my own giddiness, and come tumbling over and over from the ridge to\nthe eaves; but an honest lad, one of my nurse’ s footmen, climbed up, and\nputting me into his breeches pocket, brought me down safe.\nI was almost",

Yet I was so\nweak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by this odious\nanimal, that I was forced to keep my bed a fortnight. The king, queen, and\nall the court, sent every day to inquire after my health; and her majesty\nmade me severa l visits during my sickness. The monkey was killed, and an\norder made, that no such animal should be kept about the palace.\nWhen I attended the king after my recovery , to return him thanks for his\nfavours, he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this adventure.

And as for that monstrous animal with whom I was so lately  engaged (it\nwas indeed as large as an elephant), if my fears had suffered me to think so\nfar as to make use of my hanger ,” (looking fiercely , and clapping my hand\non the hilt, as I spoke) “when he poked his paw into my chamber , perhaps I\nshould have given him such a wound, as would have made him glad to\nwithd",

However , my speech produced nothing else beside a loud\nlaughter , which all the respect due to his majesty from those about him\ncould not make them contain. This made me reflect, how vain an attempt it\nis for a man to endeavour to do himself honour among those who are out of\nall degree of equality or comp arison with him. And yet I have seen the\nmoral of my own behaviour very frequent in England since  my return;\nwhere a little contemptible varlet, without the least title to birth, person, wit,\nor comm on sense, shall presume to look with importance, and put himself\nupon a foot with the greatest persons of the kingdom.\nI was every day fur",

I then\ntook a piece of fine wood, and cut it like the back of a comb, making\nseveral holes in it at equal distances with as small a needle as I could get\nfrom Glumdalclitch. I fixed in the stumps so artificially , scraping and\nsloping them with my knife toward the points, that I made a very tolerable\ncomb; which was a seasonable supply , my own being so much broken in the\nteeth, that it was almost useless: neither did I know any artist in that country\nso nice and exact, as would undertake to make me another .\nAnd this puts me in mind of an amusement, wherein I spent many of my\nleisure hours.

When they were finish ed, I made a present of them to her majesty;\nwho kept them in her cabinet, and used to show them for curiosities, as\nindeed they were the wonder of every one that beheld them.

Of\nthese hairs (as I had always a mechanical genius) I likewise made a neat\nlittle purse, abou t five feet long,  with her majesty’ s name deciph ered in gold\nletters, which I gave to Glumdalclitch, by the queen’ s consent . To say the\ntruth, it was more for show than use, being not of strength to bear the\nweight of the larger coins, and therefore she kept nothing in it but some\nlittle toys that girls are fond of.\nThe king, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to\nwhich I was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear them:\nbut the noise was so great that I could hardly distinguish the tunes.

My practice was to\nhave my box removed from the place where the performers sat, as far as I\ncould, then to shut the doors and windows of it, and draw the window\ncurtains; after which I found their music not disagreeable.\nI had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet. Glumdalclitch\nkept one in her chamber , and a master attended twice a week to teach her: I\ncalled it a spinet, because it somewhat resembled that instrument, and was\nplayed upon in the same manner . A fancy came into my head, that I would\nentertain the king and queen with an English tune upon this instrument. But\nthis appeared extremely difficult: for the spinet was near sixty feet long,\neach key being almost a foot wide, so that with my arms extended I could\nnot reach to above five key",
    "on this instrument. But\nthis appeared extremely difficult: for the spinet was near sixty feet long,\neach key being almost a foot wide, so that with my arms extended I could\nnot reach to above five keys, and to press them down required a good smart\nstroke with my fist, which woul d be too great a labour , and to no purpose.\nThe method I contrived was this: I prepared two round sticks, about the\nbigness of common cudgels; they were thicker at one end than the other ,\nand I covered the thicker ends with pieces of a mouse’ s skin, that by\nrapping on them I might neithe r damage the tops of the keys nor interrupt\nthe soun d. Befo re the spinet a bench was placed, about four feet below the\nkeys, and I was put upon the bench. I ran sideling upon it, that way and this,\nas fast as I could, banging the proper keys with my two sticks, and made a\nshift to play a jig, to the great satisfaction of both their majestie s; but it was\nthe most  violent exercise I ever underwent; and yet I could not stri",
    "the proper keys with my two sticks, and made a\nshift to play a jig, to the great satisfaction of both their majestie s; but it was\nthe most  violent exercise I ever underwent; and yet I could not strike above\nsixteen keys, nor consequently play the bass and treble together , as other\nartists do; which was a great disadvantage to my performance.The king, who, as I before observed, was a prince of excellent\nunderstanding, would frequently order that I should be brought in my box,\nand set upon the table in his closet: he would then command me to bring\none of my chairs out of the box, and sit down within three yards distance\nupon the top of the cabinet, which brought me almost to a level with his\nface. In this manner I had several conversations with him. I one day took\nthe freed om to tell his majesty , “that the contempt he discovered towards\nEurope, and the rest of the world, did not seem answerable to those\nexcellent qualiti es of mind that he was master of; that reason did not extend\ni",
    " majesty , “that the contempt he discovered towards\nEurope, and the rest of the world, did not seem answerable to those\nexcellent qualiti es of mind that he was master of; that reason did not extend\nitself with the bulk of the body; on the contrary , we observed in our country ,\nthat the tallest persons were usually the least provided with it; that among\nother animals, bees and ants had the reputation of more indus try, art, and\nsagacity , than many of the larger kinds; and that, as inconsiderable as he\ntook me to be, I hoped I might live to do his majesty some signal service.”\nThe king heard me with attention, and began to conceive a much better\nopinion of me than he had ever before. He desired “I would give him as\nexact an account of the government of England as I possibly could;\nbecause, as fond as princes commonly are of their own customs (for so he\nconjectured of other monarchs, by my former discourses), he should be glad\nto hear of any thing that might deserve imitation.”\nImagine",
    ", as fond as princes commonly are of their own customs (for so he\nconjectured of other monarchs, by my former discourses), he should be glad\nto hear of any thing that might deserve imitation.”\nImagine with thyself, courteous  reader , how often I then wished for the\ntongue of Demo sthenes or Cicero, that might have enabled me to celebrate\nthe prais e of my own dear native country in a style equal to its merits and\nfelicity .\nI began my discourse by informing his majesty , that our dominions\nconsisted of two islands, which composed three mighty kingdoms, under\none sovereign, beside our plantations in America. I dwelt long upon the\nfertility of our soil, and the temperature of our climate. I then spoke at large\nupon the constitution of an English parliament; partly made up of an\nillustrious body called the House  of Peers; persons of the noblest blood, and\nof the most ancient and ample patrimonies.

That these were\nthe ornament and bulwark of the kingdom, worthy followers of their mostrenowned ances tors, whose honour had been the reward of their virtue,\nfrom which their posterity were  never once known to degenera te. To these\nwere joined several holy persons, as part of that assembly , under the title of\nbishops, whose peculiar business is to take care of religion, and of those\nwho instruct the people there in.

These were searched and sought out\nthrough the whole nation, by the prince and his wisest counsellors, among\nsuch of the priesthood as were most deservedly distinguis hed by the\nsanctity of their lives, and the depth of their erudition; who were indeed the\nspiritual fathers of the cler gy and the people.\nThat the other part of the parlia ment consisted of an assembly called the\nHouse of Commons, who were all principal gentlemen, freely picked and\nculled out by the people themselves, for their great abilities and love of\ntheir country, to represent the wisdom of the whole nation. And that these\ntwo bodies made up the most august assembly in Europe; to whom, in\nconjunction with the prince, the whole legislature is committed.\nI then descende d to the courts of justice; over which the judges, those\nvenerable sages and interpreter s of the law, presided, for determin",

I mentioned the prudent management of our\ntreasury; the valour and achievements of our forces, by sea and land. I\ncomputed the number of our people, by reckoning how many millions there\nmight be of each religious sect, or political party among us. I did not omit\neven our sports and pastimes, or any other particular which I thought might\nredound to the honour of my country . And I finished all with a brief\nhistorical accoun t of affairs and events in England for about a hundred years\npast.\nThis conversation was not ended under five audiences, each of several\nhours; and the king heard the whole with great attention, frequently taking\nnotes of what I spoke, as well as memorandums ",

He asked, “What methods were used to\ncultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility , and in what kind of\nbusiness they commonly spent the first and teachable parts of their lives?\nWhat course was taken to supply that assembly , when any noble familybecame extinct? What qualifications were necessary in those who are to be\ncreated new lords: whether the humour of the prince, a sum of money to a\ncourt lady, or a design of strengthening a party opposite to the public\ninterest, ever happened to be the motive in those advancements?

What share\nof know ledge these lords had in the laws of their country , and how they\ncame by it, so as to enable them to decide the properties of their fellow-\nsubjects in the last resort? Whether they were always so free from avarice,\npartialities, or want, that a bribe , or some other sinister view , could have no\nplace among them? Whether those holy lords I spoke of were always\npromoted to that rank upon account of their knowledge in religious matters,\nand the sanctity  of their lives; had never been compliers with the times,\nwhile they were common pries ts; or slavish prostitute chaplains to some\nnobleman, whose opinions they continued servilely to follow , after they\nwere admitted into that assembly?”\nHe then desired to know , “What arts were practised in electing those\nwhom I called commoners: whether a stranger , with a strong",

How it came to\npass, that people were so viole ntly bent upon getting into this assembly ,\nwhich I allowed  to be a great trouble and expense, often to the ruin of their\nfamilies, without any salary or pension? because this appeared such an\nexalted strain of virtue and public spirit, that his majesty seemed  to doubt it\nmight possibly not be always sincere.” And he desired to know , “Whether\nsuch zealous gentlemen could have any views of refunding themselves for\nthe charges and trouble they were at by sacrificing the public good to the\ndesigns of a weak and vicious prince, in conjunction with a corrupted\nministry?” He multiplied his questions, and",
    "mselves for\nthe charges and trouble they were at by sacrificing the public good to the\ndesigns of a weak and vicious prince, in conjunction with a corrupted\nministry?” He multiplied his questions, and sifted me thoroughly upon\nevery part of this head, proposing numberless inquiries and objections,\nwhich I think it not prudent or convenient to repeat.\nUpon what I said in relation to our courts of justice, his majest y desired\nto be satisfied in several points: and this I was the better able to do, having\nbeen formerly almost ruined by a long suit in chancery , which was decreed\nfor me with costs. He asked, “What time was usually spent in determining\nbetween right and wrong, and what degree of expense? Whether advocates\nand orators had liberty to plead in causes manifestly known to be unjust,\nvexatious, or oppressive?

Whether they or their\njudges had any part in penning those laws, which they assumed the liberty\nof interpreting, and glossing upon at their pleasure? Whether they had ever,\nat different times, pleaded for and against the same cause, and cited\nprecedents to prove contrary opinions? Whether they were a rich or a poor\ncorporation? Whether they received any pecuniary reward for pleading, or\ndelivering their opinions? And particularly , whether they were ever\nadmitted as members in the lower senate?”\nHe fell next upon the management of our treasury; and said, “he thought\nmy memory had failed me, because I computed our taxes at about five or\nsix millions a year, and when I came to mention the issues, he found they\nsometim",

But, if what I told him were true, he was still at\na loss how a kingdom could run out of its estate, like a private person.” He\nasked me, “who were our creditors; and where we found money to pay\nthem?” He wondered to hear me talk of such chargeable and expensive\nwars; “that certa inly we must be a quarrelsome people, or live among very\nbad neighbours, and that our generals must needs be richer than our kings.”\nHe asked, what business we had out of our own islands, unless upon the\nscore of trade, or treaty , or to defend the coasts with our fleet?”  Above a",

He said, “if we were governed by our\nown consent, in the persons of our representatives, he could not imagine of\nwhom we were afraid, or again st whom we were to fight; and would hear\nmy opinion, whether a private man’ s house might not be better defended by\nhimself, his children, and family , than by half-a-dozen rascals, picked up at\na venture in the streets for small wages, who might get a hundred times\nmore by cutting their throats?”\nHe laughed at my “odd kind of arithmetic,” as he was pleased to call it,\n“in reckoning the numbers of our people, by a computation drawn from the\nseveral sects among us, in religion and politics.” He said, “he knew no\nreason why those, who enter",

And as it\nwas tyranny in any government to require the first, so it was weakness notto enfor ce the second: for a man may be allowed to keep poisons in his\ncloset, but not to vend them about for cordials.”\nHe observed, “that among the diversions of our nobility and gentry , I had\nmentioned gaming: he desired to know at what age this entertainment was\nusually taken up, and when it was laid down; how much of their time it\nemployed; whether it ever went so high as to affect their fortunes; whether\nmean, vicious people, by their dexterity in that art, might not arrive at great\nriches, and sometimes keep our very nobles in dependence, as well as\nhabituate them to vile companio ns, w",

    " the sum\nof all I had spoken; compared the questions he made with the answers I had\ngiven; then taking me into his hands, and stroking me gently , delivered\nhimself in these words, which I shall never forget, nor the manner he spoke\nthem in: “My little friend Grildrig, you have made a most admirable\npanegyric upon your country; you have clearly proved, that ignorance,\nidleness, and vice, are the proper ingredients for qualifying a legislator; that\nlaws are best explained, interpreted, and applied, by those whose interest\nand abilities lie in perverting, confounding, and eluding them . I observe\namong you some lines of an institution, which, in its original,  might have\nbeen tolerable, but these half erased, and the rest wholly blurred and blotted\nby corru ptions.

As for yourself,” continued the king, “who\nhave spent the greatest part of your life in travelling, I am well disposed to\nhope you may hitherto have escaped many vices of your country . But by\nwhat I have gathered from your own relation, and the answers I have withmuch pains wrung and extorted from you, I cannot but conclude the bulk of\nyour natives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that\nnature ever suf fered to crawl upon the surface of the earth.”CHAPTER VII.\nThe author ’s love of his count ry.

The laws, and military affairs, and\nparties in the state.\nNothing but an extreme love of truth could have hindered me from\nconcealing this part of my story . It was in vain to discover my resentments,\nwhich were always turned into ridicule; and I was forced to rest with\npatience, while my noble and beloved country was so injuriously treated. I\nam as heartily sorry as any of my readers can possibly be, that such an\noccasion was given: but this prince happened to be so curious and\ninquisitive upon  every particular , that it could not consist either with\ngratitude or good manners, to refuse giving him what satisfa ction I was\nable.

Yet thus much I may be allowed to say in my own vindication, that I\nartfully eluded many of his questions, and gave to every point a more\nfavourable turn, by many degre es, than the strictness of truth would allow .\nFor I have always borne that laudable partiality to my own country, which\nDionysius Halicarnassensis, with so much justice, recommends to an\nhistorian: I would hide the frailties and deformities of my political mother ,\nand place her virtues and beauties in the most advantageous light. This was\nmy sincere endeavour in those many discourses I had with that monarch,\nalthough it unfortunately failed of success.\nBut great allowances should be given to a king, who lives wholly\nsecluded from the rest of the world, and must therefore be altogether\nunacquainted with the manner s and customs that most prevail in other\nnations: the want of which knowledge will ever produce many prejudices,",

And it would be hard indeed, if\nso remote a prince’ s notions of virtue and vice were to be offered as a\nstandard for all mankind.To confirm what I have now said, and further to show the miserable\neffects of a confined education , I shall here insert a passage, which will\nhardly obtain belief. In hopes to ingratiate myself further into his majesty’ s\nfavour , I told him of “an invention, discovered between three and four\nhundred years ago, to make a certain powder , into a heap of which, the\nsmallest spark of fire falling, would kindle the whole in a moment, although\nit were as big as a mountain, and make it all fly up in the air together , with a\nnoise and agitation greater than",

That the largest balls thus discha rged, would\nnot only destroy  whole ranks of an army at once, but batter the strongest\nwalls to the ground, sink down ships, with a thousand men in each, to the\nbottom of the sea, and when linked together by a chain, would cut through\nmasts and riggi ng, divide hundreds of bodies in the middle, and lay all\nwaste before them.

As for himself, he protested, that although few things delightedhim so much as new discoveries in art or in nature, yet he would  rather lose\nhalf his kingdom , than be privy to such a secret; which he commanded me,\nas I valued any life, never to mention any more.”\nA strange effect of narr",

Neither do I say this,\nwith the least intention to detract from the many virtues of that excellent\nking, whose character , I am sensible, will, on this account, be very much\nlessened in the opinion of an English reader: but I take this defect among\nthem to have risen from their ignorance, by not having hitherto reduced\npolitics into ",

For, I\nremember very well, in a discourse one day with the king, when I happened\nto say, “there were several thousand books among us written upon the art of\ngovernment,” it gave him (directly contrary to my intention) a very mean\nopinion of our understandings. He professed both to abominate and despise\nall myst ery, refinement, and intrigue, either in a prince or a minister . He\ncould not tell what I meant by secrets of state, where an enem y, or some\nrival nation, were not in the case.

And he gav",

And he gave it for\nhis opinion, “that whoever could make two ears of corn, or two blades of\ngrass, to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would\ndeserve better of mankind, and do more essential service to his country ,\nthan the whole race of politicians put together .”\nThe learning of this people is very defective, consisting only in morality ,\nhistory , poetry , and mathematic s, wherein they must be allow ed to excel.\nBut the last of these is wholly applied to what may be useful in life, to the\nimprovement of agriculture, and all mechanical arts; so that among us, it\nwould be little esteemed.

They are expressed in the most plain and\nsimple terms, wherein those people are not mercurial enough to discover\nabove one interpretation: and to write a comment upon any law, is a capital\ncrime. As to the decision of civil causes, or proceedings agains t criminals,\ntheir precedents are so few, that they have little reason to boast of any\nextraordinary skill in either .\nThey have had the art of print ing, as well as the Chinese, time out of\nmind: but their libraries are not very large; for that of the king, which is\nreckoned the largest, does not amount to above a thousand volumes, placed\nin a gallery of twelve hundred feet long, whence I had liberty to borrow\nwhat books I pleased.

    "ble to think, not only\nthat the species of men were originally much larger, but also that there must\nhave been giants in former ages; which, as it is asserted by history and\ntradition, so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls, casually dug\nup in several parts of the kingdom, far exceeding the commo n dwindled\nrace of men in our days.” He argued, “that the very laws of nature\nabsolutely required we should have been made, in the beginning of a size\nmore large and robust; not so liable to destruction from every little accident,\nof a tile falling from a house, or a stone cast from the hand of a boy, or\nbeing drowned in a little brook .” From this way of reasoning , the author\ndrew several moral applications, useful in the conduct of life, but needless\nhere to repeat. For my own part, I could not avoid reflecting how\nuniversally this talent was spread, of drawing lectures in moralit y, or indeed\nrather matter of discontent and repining, from the quarrels we raise with\nnature.

They are indeed perfect enough in their\nexercises, and under very good discipline, wherein I saw no great merit; for\nhow should it be otherwise, where every farmer is under the command of\nhis own landlord, and every citizen under that of the principal  men in his\nown city , chosen after the manner of Venice, by ballot?\nI have often seen the ",

They were in all not above\ntwenty-five thousand foot, and six thousand horse; but it was impossible for\nme to compute their number , considering the space of ground they took up.\nA cavalier , mounted on a large steed, might be about ninety feet high. I have\nseen this whole body of horse, upon a word of command, draw their swords\nat once,  and brandish them in the air. Imagination can figure nothing sogrand, so surpris ing, and so astonishing!

But I was soon inform ed, both by\nconversation and reading their histories; for, in the course of many ages,\nthey have been troubled with the same disease to which the whole race of\nmankind is subject; the nobility often contending for power , the people for\nliberty , and the king for absolu te dominion.

He returns to England.\nI had always a strong impulse that I should some time recover my liberty ,\nthough it was impossible to conjecture by what means, or to form any\nproject with the least hope of succeeding. The ship in which I sailed, was\nthe first ever known to be driven  within sight of that coast, and the king had\ngiven strict orders, that if at any time another appeared, it should be taken\nashore, and with all its crew and passengers brought in a tumbril to\nLorbrulgrud.

I was indeed treated with much kindness: I was\nthe favourite of a great king and queen, and the delight of the whole court;\nbut it was upon such a foot as ill became the dignity of humankind. I could\nnever forget those domestic pledges I had left behind me. I wanted to be\namong people, with whom I could converse upon even terms, and walk\nabout the streets  and fields without being afraid of being trod to death like a\nfrog or a young puppy .

I was carried, as usual, in my travelling-box,\nwhich as I have already described, was a very convenient closet, of twelve\nfeet wide. And I had ordered a hammock to be fixed, by silken  ropes from\nthe four corners at the top, to break the jolts, when a servant  carried me\nbefore him on horseback, as I sometimes desired; and would often sleep in\nmy hammock, while we were upon the road. On the roof of my closet, notdirectly over the middle of the hammock, I ordered the joiner to cut out a\nhole of a foot square, to give me air in hot weather , as I slept; which hole I\nshut at pleasure  with a board that drew backward and forwar d through a\ngroove.\nWhen we came to our journey’ s end, the king thought proper to pass a\nfew days at a p",

Glumdalcl itch and I were much fatigued: I had gotten\na small cold, but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined to her chamber . I\nlonged to see the ocean, which must be the only scene of my escape, if ever\nit should happen. I pretended to be worse than I really was, and desired\nleave to take the fresh air of the sea, with a page, whom I was very fond of,\nand who had sometimes been trusted with me. I shall never forget with what\nunwillingness Glumdalclitch consented, nor the strict charge she gave the\npage to be careful of me, bursting at the same time into a flood of tears, as if\nshe had some forboding of what was to happen.

The boy took me out in my\nbox, about half an hour’s walk from the palace, towards the rocks on the\nsea-shore. I ordered him to set me down, and lifting up one of my sashes,\ncast many a wistful melancholy  look towards the sea. I found myself not\nvery well, and told the page that I had a mind to take a nap in my hammock,\nwhich I hoped would do me good. I got in, and the boy shut the window\nclose down, to keep out the cold. I soon fell asleep, and all I can conjecture\nis, while I slept, the page, thinking no danger could happen, went among the\nrocks to look for birds’  eggs, having before observed him from my window\nsearching about, and picking up one or two in the clefts.

    ". Be that as it will, I\nfound myself suddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the ring, which was\nfastened at the top of my box for the conveniency of carriage. I felt my box\nraised very high in the air, and then borne forward with prodigious speed.\nThe first jolt had like to have shaken me out of my hammock, but afterward\nthe motion was easy enough. I called out several times, as loud as I could\nraise my voice, but all to no purpose. I looked towards my windows, and\ncould see nothin g but the clouds  and sky. I heard a noise just over my head,\nlike the clapping  of wings, and then began to perceive the woful condition I\nwas in; that some eagle had got the ring of my box in his beak, with an\nintent to let it fall on a rock, like a tortoise in a shell, and then pick out my\nbody , and devou r it: for the sagacity and smell of this bird enables him to\ndiscover his quarry at a great distance, though better concealed than I could\nbe within a two-inch board.In a little time, I observed the n",

I\nheard several bangs or buffets, as I thought given to the eagle (for such I am\ncertain it must have been that held the ring of my box in his beak), and then,\nall on a sudden , felt myself falling perpendicularly down, for above a\nminute, but with such incredible swiftness, that I almost lost my breath. My\nfall was stopped by a terrible squash, that sounded louder to my ears than\nthe cataract of Niagara; after which, I was quite in the dark for another\nminute, and then my box began  to rise so high, that I could see light from\nthe tops of the windows.

My box,\nby the weight of my body , the goods that were in, and the broad plates of\niron fixed for strength at the four corners of the top and bottom, floated\nabout five feet deep in water . I did then, and do now suppose, that the eagle\nwhich flew away with my box was pursued by two or three others, and\nforced to let me drop, while he defended himself against the rest, who\nhoped to share in the prey. The plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the\nbox (for those were the strongest) preserved the balance while  it fell, and\nhindered it from being broken on the surface of the water . Every joint of it\nwas well grooved; and the door did not move on hinges, but up and down\nlike a sash, which kept my closet so tight that very little water came in.

I got\nwith much difficulty out of my hammock, having first ventured to draw\nback the slip-board on the roof already mentioned, contrived on purpose to\nlet in air , for want of which I found myself almost stifled.\nHow often did I then wish myself with my dear Glumdalcli tch, from\nwhom one single hour had so far divided me! And I may say with truth, that\nin the midst of my own misfortunes I could not forbear lamenti ng my poor\nnurse, the grief she would suffer for my loss, the displeasure of the queen,\nand the ruin of her fortune. Perhaps many travellers have not been under\ngreater difficulties and distress than I was at this juncture, expecting every\nmoment to see my box dashed to pieces, or at least overset by the first\nviolent blast, or rising wave.

A breach in one single pane of glass would\nhave been immediate death: nor could any thing have preserved the\nwindows, but the strong lattice wires placed on the outside, against\naccidents in travelling. I saw the water ooze in at several crannies, although\nthe leaks were not considerable,  and I endeavoured to stop them as well as I\ncould. I was not able to lift up the roof of my closet, which otherwise I\ncertainly should  have done, and sat on the top of it; where I might at leastpreserve myself  some hours longer, than by being shut up (as I may call it)\nin the hold. Or if I escaped these dangers for a day or two, what could I\nexpect but a miserable death of cold and hunger? I was four hours under\nthese circumstances, expecting, and indeed wishing, every moment to be\nmy last.\nI have already told the reader that there were two strong staples fixed\nupon that side of my box which had no window , and into which  the servant,\nwho used to carry me on horseb ack",

Being in this disconsolate state, I heard, or at least thought I\nheard, some kind of grating noise on that side of my box where the staples\nwere fixed; and soon after I bega n to fancy that the box was pulled or towed\nalong the sea; for I now and then felt a sort of tugging, which made the\nwaves rise near the tops of my windows, leaving me almost in the dark.\nThis gave me some faint hopes of relief, although I was not able to imagine\nhow it could be brought about. I ventured to unscrew one of my chairs,\nwhich were always fastened to the floor; and having made a hard shift to\nscrew it down again, directly under the slipping-board that I had lately\nopened, I mounted on the chair , and putting my mouth as near as I could to\nthe hole,",

I then fastened my handkerchief to a stick I usually carried, and\nthrusting it up the hole, waved it several times in the air, that if any boat or\nship were near, the seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be\nshut up in the box.\nI found no effect from all I could do, but plainly perceived my closet to\nbe moved along; and in the space of an hour, or better , that side of the box\nwhere the staple s were, and had no windows, struck against something that\nwas hard. I apprehended it to be a rock, and found myself tosse d more than\never.

I then found myself\nhoisted up, by degrees, at least three feet higher than I was before.\nWhereupon I again thrust up my stick and handkerchief, calling for help till\nI was almost hoarse. In return to which, I heard a great shout repeated three\ntimes, giving me such transports of joy as are not to be conceived but by\nthose who feel them. I now heard a trampling over my head, and somebody\ncalling through the hole with a loud voice, in the English tongu e, “If there\nbe any body below , let them speak.” I answered, “I was an Englishman,\ndrawn by ill fortune into the greatest calamity that ever any creatureunderwent, and begged, by all that was moving, to be delivere d out of the\ndungeon I was in.” The voice replied, “I was safe, for my box was fastened\nto their ship; and the carpenter should immediately come and saw a hole in\nthe cove r, larg",

The carpenter came, and in a few minutes sawed a passage about\nfour feet square, then let down a small ladder , upon which I mounted, and\nthence was taken into the ship in a very weak condition.\nThe sailors were all in amazement, and asked me a thousand questions,\nwhich I had no inclination to answer .

But the captain,\nMr. Thomas Wilcocks, an hone st worthy Shropshire man, observing I was\nready to faint, took me into his cabin, gave me a cordial to comfort me, and\nmade me turn in upon his own bed, advising me to take a little rest, of\nwhich I had great need. Before  I went to sleep, I gave him to understand\nthat I had some valuable furniture in my box, too good to be lost: a fine\nhammock, a handsome field-bed, two chairs, a table, and a cabinet; that my\ncloset was hung on all sides, or rather quilted, with silk and cotton; that if\nhe would let one of the crew bring my closet into his cabin, I would open it\nthere before him, and show him my goods.

The captain, heari ng me utter\nthese absurdities, concluded I was raving; however (I suppose to pacify me)\nhe promised to give order as I desired, and going upon deck, sent some of\nhis men down into my closet, whence (as I afterwards found) they drew up\nall my goods, and stripped off the quilting; but the chairs, cabinet, and\nbedstead, being screwed to the floor , were much damaged by the ignorance\nof the seamen, who tore them up by force. Then they knocked off some of\nthe boards for the use of the ship, and when they had got all they had a\nmind for, let the hull drop into the sea, which by reason of many breaches\nmade in the bottom and sides, sunk to rights.

However , upon waking, I found\nmyself much recovered. It was now about eight o’clock at night, and the\ncaptain ordered supper immedia tely, thinking I had already fasted too long.\nHe entertained me with great kindness, observing me not to look wildly , or\ntalk inconsistently: and, when we were left alone, desired I would give him\na relation of my travels, and by what accident I came to be set adrift, in that\nmonstrous wood en chest.

Iassured him, “I was well refreshed with his good entertainment and\ncompany , and as much in my senses as ever I was in my life.” He then grew\nserious, and desired to ask me freely , “whether I were not troubled in my\nmind by the consciousness of some enormous crime, for which I was\npunished, at the command of some prince, by exposing me in that chest; as\ngreat criminals, in other countries, hav",

But further to\nconfirm all I had said, I entreated him to give order that my cabinet should\nbe brought, of which I had the key in my pocket; for he had already\ninformed me how the seamen disposed of my closet. I opened it in his own\npresence, and showed him the small collection of rarities I made in the\ncountry from which I had been so strangely delivered. There was the comb I\nhad contrived out of the stumps of the king’ s beard, and another of the same\nmaterials, but fixed into a paring  of her majesty’ s thumb-nail, which served\nfor the back. There was a collec tion of needles and pins, from a foot to half\na yard long; four wasp stings, like joiner ’s tacks; some combings of the\nqueen’ s hair; a gold ring, which one day she made me a present of, in a\nmost obliging ",

I desired the captain would please to accept this ring\nin return for his civilities; which  he absolutely refused. I showed him a corn\nthat I had cut off with my own hand, from a maid of honour ’s toe; it was\nabout the bigness of Kentish pippin, and grown so hard, that when I\nreturned to England, I got it hollowed into a cup, and set in silver. Lastly , I\ndesired him to see the breeches I had then on, which were  made of a\nmouse’ s skin.\nI could force nothing on him but a footman’ s tooth, which I observed him\nto examine with great curiosity , and found he had a fancy for it.

I got it cleaned, and put it into my cabinet. It was about a foot\nlong, and four inches in diameter .\nThe captain was very well satisfied with this plain relation I had given\nhim, and said, “he hoped, when we returned to England, I woul d oblige the\nworld by putting it on paper , and making it public.” My answe r was, “that\nwe were overstocked with books of travels: that nothing could now pass\nwhich was not extraordinary;  wherein I doubted some authors less\nconsulted truth, than their own vanity , or interest, or the diversion of\nignorant readers; that my story could contain little beside common events,\nwithout those ornamental descriptions of strange plants, trees, birds, a",

For, although the queen had ordered alittle equipage of all things necessary for me, while I was in her service, yet\nmy ideas were wholly taken up with what I saw on every side of me, and I\nwinked at my own littleness, as people do at their own faults. The captain\nunderstood my raillery very well, and merrily replied with the old English\nproverb, “that he doubted my eyes were bigger than my belly , for he did not\nobserve my stomach so good, although I had fasted all day;” and,\ncontinuing in his mirth, protested “he would have gladly given  a hundred\npounds, to have seen my closet in the eagle’ s bill, and afterwards in its fall\nfrom so grea",
    "hough I had fasted all day;” and,\ncontinuing in his mirth, protested “he would have gladly given  a hundred\npounds, to have seen my closet in the eagle’ s bill, and afterwards in its fall\nfrom so great a height into the sea; which would certainly have been a most\nastonishing object, worthy to have the description of it transmitted to future\nages:” and the comparison of Phaeton was so obvious, that he could not\nforbear applying it, although I did not much admire the conceit.\nThe captain having been at Tonquin, was, in his return to England, driven\nnorth-eastward to the latitude of 44 degrees, and longitude of 143. But\nmeeting a trade-wind two days after I came on board him, we sailed\nsouthward a long time, and coasting New Holland, kept our course west-\nsouth-west, and then south-south-west, till we doubled the Cape of Good\nHope. Our voyage was very prosperous, but I shall not trouble the reader\nwith a journal of it. The captain called in at one or two ports, and sent in his\nlong-boat f",
    ", till we doubled the Cape of Good\nHope. Our voyage was very prosperous, but I shall not trouble the reader\nwith a journal of it. The captain called in at one or two ports, and sent in his\nlong-boat for provisions and fresh water; but I never went out of the ship till\nwe came into the Downs, which was on the third day of June, 1706, about\nnine months after my escape. I offered to leave my goods in security for\npayment of my freight: but the captain protested he would not receive one\nfarthing. We took a kind leave of each other , and I made him promise he\nwould come to see me at my house in Redrif f. I hired a horse and guide for\nfive shillings, which I borrowed of the captain.\nAs I was on the road, observing the littleness of the houses, the trees, the\ncattle, and the people, I began to think myself in Lilliput.

I was afraid of\ntrampling on every traveller I met, and often called aloud to have them\nstand out of the way, so that I had like to have gotten one or two broken\nheads for my impertinence.\nWhen I came to my own house, for which I was forced to inqui re, one of\nthe servants opening the door, I bent down to go in, (like a goose under a\ngate,) for fear of striking my head. My wife ran out to embrac e me, but I\nstooped lower than her knees, thinking she could otherwise neve r be able to\nreach my mouth. My daughter kneeled to ask my blessing, but I could notsee her till she arose, having been so long used to stand with my head and\neyes erect to above sixty feet; and then I went to take her up with one hand\nby the waist. I looked down upon the servants, and one or two friends who\nwere in the house, as if they had been pigmies and I a giant.

I told my wife,\n“she had been too thrifty , for I found she had starved herself and her\ndaughter to nothing.” In short, I behaved myself so unaccountably , that they\nwere all of the captain’ s opinion  when he first saw me, and conc luded I had\nlost my wits. This I mention as an instance of the great power of habit and\nprejudice.\nIn a little time, I and my family and friends came to a right\nunderstanding: but my wife protested “I should never go to sea any more;”\nalthough my evil destiny so ordered, that she had not power to hinder me,\nas the reader may know hereafter . In the mean time, I here conclude the\nsecond part of my unfortunate voyages.PART III.

He is\nreceived into Laputa.\nI had not been at home above ten days, when Captain William Robinson,\na Cornish man, commander of the Hopewell, a stout ship of three hundred\ntons, came to my house. I had formerly been surgeon of another ship where\nhe was master , and a fourth part owner , in a voyage to the Levant. He had\nalways treated me more like a brother , than an inferior officer; and, hearing\nof my arrival, made me a visit, as I apprehended only out of friendship, for\nnothing passed more than what  is usual after long absences. But repeating\nhis visits often, expressing his joy to find me in good health, asking,\n“whether I were now settled for life?” adding, “that he intended a voyage to\nthe East Indies in two months,”  at last he plainly invited me, though with\nsome apologies , to be surgeon  of the ship; “that I should have another\nsurgeon under me, beside o",

We staid there three weeks to refresh our crew , many of\nwhom were sick. From thence we went to Tonquin, where the captain\nresolved to continue some time, because many of the goods he intended to\nbuy were not ready , nor could he expect to be dispatched in several months.\nTherefore, in hopes to defray some of the charges he must be at, he boughta sloop, loaded it with several sorts of goods, wherewith the Tonquinese\nusually trade to the neighbour ing islands, and putting fourteen men on\nboard, whereof three were of the country , he appointed me master of the\nsloop, and gave me power to traffic, while he transacted his affairs at\nTonquin.\nWe had not sailed above three days, when a great storm arising, we were\ndriven five days to the north-north-east, and then to the east: after which we\nhad fair weather , but still with a pretty strong gale from the west.

    " three days, when a great storm arising, we were\ndriven five days to the north-north-east, and then to the east: after which we\nhad fair weather , but still with a pretty strong gale from the west. Upon the\ntenth day we were chased by two pirates, who soon overtook  us; for my\nsloop was so deep laden, that she sailed very slow, neither were we in a\ncondition to defend ourselves.\nWe were  boarde d about the same time by both the pirates, who entered\nfuriously at the head of their men; but finding us all prostrate upon our\nfaces (for so I gave order), they pinioned us with strong ropes, and setting\nguard upon us, went to search the sloop.\nI observ ed among them a Dutchman, who seemed to be of some\nauthority , though he was not commander of either ship. He knew us by our\ncountenances to be Englishmen , and jabbering to us in his own language,\nswore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea.

I spoke\nDutch tolerably  well; I told him who we were, and begged him, in\nconsideration of our being Christians and Protestants, of neighbouring\ncountries in strict alliance, that he would move the captains to take some\npity on us. This inflamed his rage; he repeated his threatenings, and turning\nto his companions, spoke with great vehemence in the Japanese language,\nas I suppose, often using the word Christianos .\nThe largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a Japanese\ncaptain, who spoke a little Dutch, but very imperfectly . He came up to me,\nand after several  questions, which I answered in great humility , he said, “we\nshould not die.” I made the captain a very low bow, and then, turning to the\nDutchman, said, “I was sorry to find more mercy in a heathen, than in a\nbrother christian.” But I had soon reason to repent those foolish  words: for\nthat malicious repro",

My men were sent by an equal division intoboth the pirate ships, and my sloop new manned. As to myself, it was\ndetermined that I should be set adrift in a small canoe, with paddles and a\nsail, and four days’  provisions; which last, the Japanese captain was so kind\nto double out of his own stores, and would permit no man to search me.

When I was at\nsome distance from the pirates, I discovered, by my pocket-glass, several\nislands to the south-east. I set up my sail, the wind being fair, with a design\nto reach  the nearest of those islands, which I made a shift to do, in about\nthree hours. It was all rocky: however I got many birds’  eggs; and, striking\nfire, I kindled some heath and dry sea-weed, by which I roasted  my eggs. I\nate no other supper , being resolved to spare my provisions as much as I\ncould.

But, not to trouble the\nreader with a particular account of my distresses, let it suffice, that on the\nfifth day I arrived at the last island in my sight, which lay south-south-east\nto the former .\nThis island was at a greater distance than I expected, and I did not reach\nit in less than five hours. I encom passed it almost round, before I could find\na convenient place to land in; which was a small creek, about  three times\nthe wide ness of my canoe. I found the island to be all rocky , only a little\nintermingled with tufts of grass, and sweet-smelling herbs.

I lay all night in the\ncave where I had lodged my provisions. My bed was the same dry grass and\nsea-weed which  I intended for fuel. I slept very little, for the disquiets of\nmy mind prevailed over my weariness, and kept me awake. I considered\nhow impossible it was to preserve my life in so desolate a place, and how\nmiserable my end must be: yet found myself so listless and desponding, thatI had not the heart to rise; and before I could get spirits enough to creep out\nof my cave, the day was far advanced.

    "d before I could get spirits enough to creep out\nof my cave, the day was far advanced. I walked awhile among the rocks:\nthe sky was perfectly clear , and the sun so hot, that I was forced to turn my\nface from it: when all on a sudden it became obscure, as I thought, in a\nmanner very different from what happens by the interposition of a cloud. I\nturned back, and perceived a vast opaque body between me and the sun\nmoving forward s towards the island: it seemed to be about two miles high,\nand hid the sun six or seven minutes; but I did not observe the air to be\nmuch colder, or the sky more darkened, than if I had stood under the shade\nof a mountain. As it approached nearer over the place where I was, it\nappeared to be a firm substance, the bottom flat, smooth, and shining very\nbright, from the reflection of the sea below . I stood upon a height about two\nhundred yards from the shore, and saw this vast body descending almost to\na paralle l with me, at less than an English mile distance. I ",

I took out my\npocket perspective, and could plainly discover numbers of people moving\nup and down the sides of it, which appeared to be sloping; but what those\npeople were doing I was not able to distinguish.\nThe natural love of life gave me some inward motion of joy, and I was\nready to entertain a hope that this adventure might, some way or other , help\nto deliver me from the desolat e place and condition I was in. But at the\nsame time the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment, to behold an\nisland in the air, inhabited by men, who were able (as it shou ld seem) to\nraise or sink, or put it into progressive motion, as they pleased.

Yet soon after, it advanced nearer , and I\ncould see the sides of it encompassed with several gradations of galleries,\nand stairs, at certain intervals, to descend from one to the other . In the\nlowest gallery , I beheld some people fishing with long angling rods, and\nothers looking on. I waved my cap (for my hat was long since worn out)\nand my handkerchief toward the island; and upon its nearer approach, I\ncalled and shout ed with the utmost strength of my voice; and then looking\ncircumspectly , I beheld a crowd  gather to that side which was most in my\nview .

But I\ncould see four or five men running in great haste, up the stairs, to the top ofthe islan d, who then disappeared. I happened rightly to conjecture, that\nthese were sent for orders to some person in authority upon this occasion.\nThe number of people increased, and, in less than half an hour, the island\nwas moved and raised in such a manner , that the lowest gallery appeared in\na parallel of less than a hundred yards distance from the height where I\nstood. I then put myself in the most supplicating posture, and spoke in the\nhumblest accent , but received no answer . Those who stood nearest over\nagainst me, seemed to be persons of distinction, as I supposed by their\nhabit. They conferred earnestly with each other , looking often upon me.

They beheld me with all the\nmarks and circumstances of wonder; neither indeed was I much in their\ndebt, having never till then seen a race of mortals so singular in their\nshapes, habits, and countenances . Their heads were all reclined, either to the\nright, or the left; one of their eyes turned inward, and the other  directly up\nto the zenith. Their outward garments were adorned with the figures of\nsuns, moons, and stars; interwoven with those of fiddles, flutes, harps,\ntrumpets, guitars, harpsichords, and many other instruments of music,\nunknown to us in Europe.

In each bladder was a small quantity of\ndried peas, or little pebbles, as I was afterwards informed. With these\nbladders, they now and then flapped the mouths and ears of those who\nstood near them, of which practi ce I could not then conceive the meaning. It\nseems the minds  of these people  are so taken up with intense speculations,\nthat they neither  can speak, nor attend to the discourses of others, without\nbeing roused by some externa l taction upon the organs of speech and\nhearing; for which reason, those persons who are able to afford it always\nkeep a flapper (the original is climenole ) in their family , as one of their\ndomestics; nor ever walk abroad, or make visits, without him.

Before the throne, was a large table filled with\nglobes and spheres, and mathematical instruments of all kinds.

But\nhe was then deep in a problem; and we attended at least an hour, before he\ncould solve it. There stood by him, on each side, a young page with flaps in\ntheir hands, and when they saw he was at leisure, one of them gently struck\nhis mouth, and the other his right ear; at which he startled like one awaked\non the sudden, and looking towards me and the company  I was in,\nrecollected the occasion of our coming, whereof he had been informed\nbefore. He spoke some words, whereupon immediately a young man with a\nflap came up to my side, and flapped me gently on the right ear; but I made\nsigns, as well as I could, that I had no occasion for such an instrument;\nwhich, as I afterwards found, gave his majesty , and the whole court, a very\nmean opinion of my understanding.

The king, as far as I could conjecture,\nasked me several questions, and I addressed myself to him in all the\nlanguages I had. When it was found I could neither understand nor be\nunderstood, I was conducted by his order to an apartment in his palace (this\nprince being distinguished above all his predecessors for his hospitality to\nstrangers), where two servants were appointed to attend me. My dinner was\nbrought, and four persons of quality , whom I remembered to have seen very\nnear the king’ s person, did me the honour to dine with me. We had two\ncourses, of three dishes each. In the first course, there was a shoulder of\nmutton cut into an equilateral triangle, a piece of beef into a rhomboides,and a pudding into a cycloid.

The servants cut our\nbread into cones, cylinders, parallelograms, and several other mathematical\nfigures.\nWhile we were at dinner , I made bold to ask the names of several things\nin their language, and those noble persons, by the assistance of their\nflappers, delighted to give me answers, hoping to raise my admiration of\ntheir great abilities if I could be brought to converse with them.

The word, which I interpret the flying  or floating\nisland, is in the original Laputa , whereof I could never learn the true\netymology . Lap, in the old obso lete language, signifies high; and untuh , a\ngovernor; from which they say, by corruption, was derived Laputa , from\nLapuntuh . But I do not approve of this derivation, which seems to be a little\nstrained. I ventured to offer to the learned among them a conjecture of my\nown, that Laputa was quasi lap outed ; lap, signify ing properly , the dancing\nof the sunbeams in the sea, and outed , a wing; which,  however , I shall not\nobtrude, but submit to the judicious reader .\nThose to whom the king had entrusted me, observing how ill I was clad,\nordered a tailor to come next morning, and take measure for a suit ",

And to this purpose, several\npackthreads were let down, with small weights at the bottom . On these\npackthreads the people strung their petitions, which mounted up directly ,\nlike the scraps of paper fastened  by schoolboys at the end of the string that\nholds their kite. Sometimes we received wine and victuals from below ,\nwhich were drawn up by pulleys.\nThe knowledge I had in mathematics gave me great assistance in\nacquiring their phraseology , which depended much upon that science, and\nmusic; and in the latter I was not unskilled.

For if,\nin its perihelion, it should approach within a certain degree of the sun (as by\ntheir calculations they have reason to dread) it will receive a degree of heat\nten thousand times more intense than that of red hot glowing iron, and in its\nabsence from the sun, carry a blazing tail ten hundred thousand and\nfourteen miles long, through which, if the earth should pass at the distance\nof one hundred thousand miles from the nucleus, or main body of the\ncomet, it must in its passage be set on fire, and reduced to ashes: that the\nsun, daily spend ing its rays without any nutriment to supply them, will at\nlast be wholly consumed and annihilated; ",

I chiefly\nwanted to know , to what cause, in art or in nature, it owed its several\nmotions, whereof I will now give a philosophical account to the reader .\nThe flying or floating island is exactly circular , its diameter 7837 yards,\nor about four miles and a half, and consequently contains ten thousand\nacres. It is three hundred yards thick. The bottom, or under surface, which\nappears to those who view it below, is one even regular plate of adamant,\nshooting up to the height of about two hundred yards. Abov e it lie the\nseveral minerals in their usual order, and over all is a coat of rich mould, ten\nor twelve feet deep. The declivity of the upper surface , from the\ncircumference to the centre, is the natural cause why all the dews and rains,\nwhich fall upon the island, are conveyed in small rivulets toward the\nmiddle, where they are emptied into four large basins, each of about",
    " the centre, is the natural cause why all the dews and rains,\nwhich fall upon the island, are conveyed in small rivulets toward the\nmiddle, where they are emptied into four large basins, each of about half a\nmile in circuit, and two hundred yards distant from the centre. From these\nbasins the water is continually exhaled by the sun in the daytime, which\neffectually prevents their overflowing. Besides, as it is in the power of the\nmonarch to raise the island abov e the region of clouds and vapours, he can\nprevent the falling of dews and rain whenever he pleases. For the highest\nclouds cannot rise above two miles, as naturalists agree, at least they were\nnever known to do so in that country .\nAt the centre of the island there is a chasm about fifty yards in diameter ,\nwhence the astronomers desce nd into a large dome, which is therefore\ncalled flandona gagnol e, or the astronomer ’s cave, situated at the depth of a\nhundred yards beneath the uppe r surface of the adamant.

    "desce nd into a large dome, which is therefore\ncalled flandona gagnol e, or the astronomer ’s cave, situated at the depth of a\nhundred yards beneath the uppe r surface of the adamant. In this cave are\ntwenty lamps continually burning, which, from the reflection of the\nadamant, cast a strong light into every part. The place is stored with greatvariety of sextants, quadrants, telescopes, astrolabes, and other astronomical\ninstruments. But the greatest curiosity , upon which the fate of the island\ndepends, is a loadstone of a prodigious size, in shape resembling a weaver ’s\nshuttle. It is in length six yards, and in the thickest part at least three yards\nover. This magn et is sustained by a very strong axle of adam ant passing\nthrough its middle, upon which it plays, and is poised so exactly that the\nweakest hand can turn it. It is hooped round with a hollow cylinder of\nadamant, four feet deep, as many thick, and twelve yards in diameter ,\nplaced horizontally , and support ed by eight ada",
    "that the\nweakest hand can turn it. It is hooped round with a hollow cylinder of\nadamant, four feet deep, as many thick, and twelve yards in diameter ,\nplaced horizontally , and support ed by eight adamantine feet, each six yards\nhigh. In the middle of the concave side, there is a groove twelve inches\ndeep, in which the extremities of the axle are lodged, and turned round as\nthere is occasion.\nThe stone cannot be removed from its place by any force, because the\nhoop and its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant which\nconstitutes the bottom of the island.\nBy means of this loadstone, the island is made to rise and fall, and move\nfrom one place to another . For, with respect to that part of the earth over\nwhich the monarch presides, the stone is endued at one of its sides with an\nattractive power , and at the other with a repulsive. Upon placing the magnet\nerect, with its attracting end towards the earth, the island descends; but\nwhen the repelli ng extremity points downwa",
    " an\nattractive power , and at the other with a repulsive. Upon placing the magnet\nerect, with its attracting end towards the earth, the island descends; but\nwhen the repelli ng extremity points downwards, the island mounts directly\nupwards. When the position of the stone is oblique, the motion of the island\nis so too. For in this magnet, the forces always act in lines parallel to its\ndirection.\nBy this oblique motion, the island is conveyed to different parts of the\nmonarch’ s dominions. To explain the manner of its progress, let A B\nrepresent a line drawn across the dominions of Balnibarbi, let the line c d\nrepresent the loadstone, of which let d be the repellin g end, and c the\nattracting end, the island being over C; let the stone be placed in the\nposition c d, with its repelling end downwards; then the island will be\ndriven upwards obliquely towar ds D. When it is arrived at D, let the stone\nbe turne d upon its axle, till its attracting end points towards E, and then the\nisland wil",
    "wnwards; then the island will be\ndriven upwards obliquely towar ds D. When it is arrived at D, let the stone\nbe turne d upon its axle, till its attracting end points towards E, and then the\nisland will be carried obliquely  towards E; where,  if the stone be again\nturned upon its axle till it stands in the position E F, with its repelling point\ndownwards, the island will rise obliquely towards F, where, by directing the\nattracting end towards G, the island may be carried to G, and from G to H,by turning the stone, so as to make its repelling extremity to point directly\ndownward. And thus, by changing the situation of the stone, as often as\nthere is occasion , the island is made to rise and fall by turns in an oblique\ndirection, and by those alternate risings and fallings (the obliqui ty being not\nconsiderable) is conveyed from one part of the dominions to the other .\nBut it must be observed, that this island cannot move beyond the extent\nof the dominion s below , nor can it rise above ",
    "ing not\nconsiderable) is conveyed from one part of the dominions to the other .\nBut it must be observed, that this island cannot move beyond the extent\nof the dominion s below , nor can it rise above the height of four miles. For\nwhich the astronomers (who have written large systems concerning the\nstone) assign the following reaso n: that the magnetic virtue does not extend\nbeyond the distance of four miles, and that the mineral, which acts upon the\nstone in the bowels of the earth, and in the sea about six leagues distant\nfrom the shore, is not diffused through the whole globe, but terminated with\nthe limit s of the king’ s dominion s; and it was easy, from the great advantage\nof such a superior situation, for a prince to bring under his obedience\nwhatever country lay within the attraction of that magnet.\nWhen the stone  is put parallel to the plane of the horizon, the island\nstands still; for in that case the extremities of it, being at equal distance\nfrom the earth, act with equal f",
    "n of that magnet.\nWhen the stone  is put parallel to the plane of the horizon, the island\nstands still; for in that case the extremities of it, being at equal distance\nfrom the earth, act with equal force, the one in drawing downwards, the\nother in pushing upwards, and consequently no motion can ensue.\nThis loadstone is under the care of certain astronomers, who, from time\nto time, give it such positions as the monarch directs. They spend the\ngreatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies, which they do\nby the assistance of glasses, far excelling ours in goodness. For, although\ntheir largest telescopes do not exceed three feet, they magnify much more\nthan those of a hundred with us, and show the stars with greate r clearness.\nThis advantage has enabled them to extend their discoveries much further\nthan our astrono mers in Europe; for they have made a catalogue of ten\nthousand fixed stars, whereas the largest of ours do not contain above one\nthird part of that number .

The first and the mildest course is, by keeping\nthe island hovering over such a town, and the lands about it, whereby he\ncan deprive them of the benefit  of the sun and the rain, and consequentl",

The first and the mildest course is, by keeping\nthe island hovering over such a town, and the lands about it, whereby he\ncan deprive them of the benefit  of the sun and the rain, and consequently\nafflict the inhabitants with dearth and diseases. And if the crime deserve it,\nthey are at the same time pelted from above with great stones, against\nwhich they have  no defence but by creeping into cellars or caves, while the\nroofs of their houses are beaten to pieces. But if they still continue\nobstinate, or offer to raise insurrections, he proceeds to the last remedy , by\nletting the island drop directly upon their heads, which makes  a universal\ndestruction both of houses and men. However , this is an extremity to which\nthe prince is seldom driven, neither indeed is he willing to put it in\nexecution; nor dare his ministers  advise him to an action, which, as it would\nrender them odious to the peop le, so it would be a great damage to their\nown estates, which all lie below; for the is",

For, if the town intended to be destroyed\nshould have in it any tall rocks, as it generally falls out in the larger cities, a\nsituation probab ly chosen at first with a view to prevent such a catastrophe;\nor if it abound in high spires, or pillars of stone, a sudden  fall might\nendanger the bottom or under surface of the island, which, although it\nconsist, as I have said, of one entire adamant, two hundred yards thick,\nmight happen to crack by too great a shock, or burst by approaching too\nnear the fires from the houses below , as the backs, both of iron and stone,will often do in our ch",
    "nt, two hundred yards thick,\nmight happen to crack by too great a shock, or burst by approaching too\nnear the fires from the houses below , as the backs, both of iron and stone,will often do in our chimneys. Of all this the people are well apprised, and\nunderstand how far to carry their obstinacy , where their liberty or property\nis concerned. And the king, when he is highest provoked , and most\ndetermined to press a city to rubbish, orders the island to descen d with great\ngentleness, out of a pretence of tenderness to his people, but, indeed, for\nfear of breaking the adamantine bottom; in which case, it is the opinion of\nall their philosophers, that the loadstone could no longer hold it up, and the\nwhole mass would fall to the ground.\nAbout three years before my arrival among them, while the king was in\nhis progress over his dominions , there happened an extraordinary accident\nwhich had like to have put a period to the fate of that monarchy , at least as\nit is now instituted.

Lindalino, the second city in the kingdom, was the first\nhis majesty visited in his progress. Three days after his departure the\ninhabitants, who had often complained of great oppressions, shut the town\ngates, seized on the governor , and with incredible speed and labour erected\nfour large towers, one at every corner of the city (which is an exact square),\nequal in height to a strong pointed rock that stands directly in the centre of\nthe city. Upon the top of each tower , as well as upon the rock, they fixed a\ngreat loadstone, and in case their design should fail, they had provided a\nvast quantity of the most combustible fuel, hoping to burst therewith the\nadamantine bottom of the island, if the loadstone project should miscarry .\nIt was eight months before the king had perfect notice that the\nLi",

He then commanded that the island should\nbe wafte d over the city. The people were unanimous, and had laid in store\nof provi sions, and a great river runs through the middle of the town. The\nking hovered over them several days to deprive them of the sun and the\nrain. He ordered  many packthreads to be let down, yet not a person offered\nto send up a petition, but instead thereof very bold demands, the redress of\nall their grievanc es, great immunities, the choice of their own governor , and\nother the like exorbitances. Upon which his majesty comman ded all the\ninhabitants of the island to cast great stones from the lower gallery into the\ntown; but the citizens had provided against this mischief by conveying their\npersons and effects into the four towers, and ot",

This was accordingly done; but the officers employed in that\nwork found the descent much speedier than usual, and by turning the\nloadstone could not without great difficulty keep it in a firm position, but\nfound the island  inclining to fall. They sent the king immediate intelligence\nof this astonishing event, and begged his majesty’ s permission to raise the\nisland higher; the king consent ed, a general council was called, and the\nofficers of the loadstone ordered to attend.

I soon\nfound out the person’ s house to whom I was recommended, presented my\nletter from his friend the grande e in the island, and was received with much\nkindness. This great lord, whose name was Munodi, ordered me an\napartment in his own house, where I continued during my stay, and was\nentertained in a most hospitable manner .\nThe next morning after my arrival, he took me in his chariot to see the\ntown, which is about half the bigness of London; but the houses very\nstrangely built, and most of them out of repair .

I could not forbe ar admiring at these odd appea rances, both\nin town and country; and I made bold to desire my conductor , that he would\nbe pleased to explain to me, what could be meant by so many busy heads,\nhands, and faces, both in the streets and the fields, becaus e I did not\ndiscover any good effects they produced; but, on the contrary , I never knew\na soil so unhappily cultivated, houses so ill contrived and so ruinous, or a\npeople whose countenances and habit expressed so much misery and want.\nThis lord Munodi was a person of the first rank, and had been",

However , the king treated him with tenderness, as a well-\nmeaning man, but of a low contemptible understanding.\nWhen I gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants, he made\nno further answer than by telling me, “that I had not been long enough\namong them to form a judgmen t; and that the different nations of the world\nhad different customs;” with other common topics to the same purpose. But,\nwhen we returned to his palace, he asked me “how I liked the building,\nwhat absurdities I observed, and what quarrel I had with the dress or looks\nof his domestics?” This he might safely do; because every thing about him\nwas magnificent, regular , and polite. I answered, “that his excellency",

I answered, “that his excellency’ s\nprudence, qualit y, and fortune, had exempted him from those defects, which\nfolly and beggary had produced in others.” He said, “if I would go with him\nto his country-house, about twenty miles distant, where his estate lay, there\nwould be more leisure for this kind of conversation.” I told his excellency\n“that I was entirely at his disposal;” and accordingly we set out next\nmorning.\nDuring our journey he made me observe the several methods used by\nfarmers in managing their lands, which to me were wholly unaccountable;\nfor, except in some very few places, I could not discover one ear of corn or\nblade of grass.

Neith er do I remember to have seen a more delightful prospect.\nHis excellency observed my countenance to clear up; he told me, with a\nsigh, “that there his estate began, and would continue the same, till we\nshould come to his house: that his countrymen ridiculed and despised him,for managing his affairs no better, and for setting so ill an example to the\nkingdom; which , however , was followed by very few, such as were old, and\nwilful, and weak like himself.”\nWe came at length to the house, which was indeed a noble struc ture, built\naccording to the best rules of ancient architecture.

Every room has in it one or more projectors; and I believe I could\nnot be in fewer than five hundred rooms.\nThe first man I saw was of a meagre aspect, with sooty hands and face,\nhis hair and beard long, ragged, and singed in several places.

He told me, he did not doubt, that, in eight years more, he should\nbe able to supply the governor ’s gardens with sunshine, at a reasonable rate;\nbut he complained that his stock was low, and entreated me “to give him\nsomething as an encouragement  to ingenuity , especially since this had been\na very dear season for cucumber s.” I made him a small present, for my lord\nhad furnished me with money on purpose, because he knew their practice of\nbegging from all who go to see them.\nI went into another chamber , but was ready to hasten back, being almost\novercome with a horrible stink.

When I\nwas presented to him, he gave me a close embrace, a compliment I could\nwell have excused. His empl oyment, from his first coming into theacademy , was an operation to reduce human excrement to its original food,\nby separ ating the several parts, removing the tincture which it receives from\nthe gall, making the odour exha le, and scumming off the saliva. He had a\nweekly allowance, from the society , of a vessel filled with human ordure,\nabout the bigness of a Bristol barrel.\nI saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder; who likewise\nshowed me a treatise he had written concerning the malleability of fire,\nwhich he intended to publish.\nThere ",

    " This artist is much\nencouraged and esteemed by the whole fraternity .\nIn another apartment I was highly pleased with a projector who had\nfound a device of ploughing the ground with hogs, to save the charges of\nploughs, cattle, and labour . The method is this: in an acre of ground you\nbury, at six inches distance and eight deep, a quantity of acorns, dates,\nchestnuts, and other mast or vegetables, whereof these animals are fondest;\nthen you drive six hundred or more of them into the field, where, in a few\ndays, they will root up the whole  ground in search of their food, and make it\nfit for sowing, at the same time manuring it with their dung: it is true, upon\nexperiment, they found the charge and trouble very great, and they had little\nor no crop.

He\nhad a large pair of bellows, with a long slender muzzle of ivory .

The artist himself was at that time busy\nupon two great designs; the first, to sow land with chaff, wherein he\naffirmed the true seminal virtu e to be contained, as he demonstrated by\nseveral experiments, which I was not skilful enough to comprehend. The\nother was, by a certain compo sition of gums, minerals, and vegetables,\noutwardly applied, to prevent the growth of wool upon two young lambs;\nand he hoped, in a reasonable time to propagate the breed of naked sheep,\nall over the kingdom.\nWe crossed a walk to the other part of the academy , where, as I have\nalready said, the projectors in speculative learning resided.\nThe first profes sor I saw, was in a very large room, with forty pupils\nabout him.

Every one knew how laborious the usual method is of attaining to arts\nand sciences; whereas, by his contrivance, the most ignorant person, at a\nreasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour , might write books in\nphilosophy , poetry , politics, laws, mathematics, and theology , without the\nleast assistance from genius or study .” He then led me to the frame, about\nthe sides , where of all his pupils stood in ranks.

These bits of wood were covered,\non every square, with paper pasted on them; and on these papers were\nwritten all the words of their language, in their several moods, tenses, and\ndeclensions; but without any order . The professor then desired me “to\nobserve; for he was going to set his engine at work.” The pupils, at his\ncommand, took each of them hold of an iron handle, whereof there were\nforty fixed round the edges of the frame; and giving them a sudd en turn, the\nwhole disposition of the words was entirely changed.

For it is plain, that every word we speak is, in some degree,a diminution of our lungs by corrosion, and, consequently , contributes to\nthe shortening of our lives.

An expedient was therefore offered, “that since\nwords are only names for things , it would be more convenient for all men to\ncarry about them such things as were necessary to express a particular\nbusiness they are to discourse on.” And this invention would certainly have\ntaken place, to the great ease as well as health of the subject, if the women,\nin conjunction with the vulgar and illiterate, had not threatened to raise a\nrebellion unless they might be allowed the liberty to speak with their\ntongues, after the manner of their forefathers; such constant irreconcilable\nenemies to science are the common people. However , many of the most\nlearned and wise adhere to the new scheme of expressing themselves by\nthings; which has only this inconvenience attending it, that if a man’ s\nbusiness be very great, and of various kinds, he must be obliged, in\nproportion, t",

I have often beheld two of\nthose sages almost sinking under the weight of their packs, like pedlars\namong us, who, when they met in the street, would lay down their loads,\nopen their sacks, and hold conversation for an hour together; then put up\ntheir implements, help each other to resume their burdens, and take their\nleave.\nBut for short conversations, a man may carry implements in his pockets,\nand under his arms, enough to supply him; and in his house, he cannot be at\na loss.

And thus\nambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign princes, or ministers\nof state, to whose tongues they were utter strangers.\nI was at the mathematical school, where the master taught his pupils after\na method scarce imaginable to us in Europe.

This illustrious person had very usefully\nemployed his studies, in finding  out effectual remedies for all diseases and\ncorruptions to which the several kinds of public administration are subject,\nby the vices or infirmities of those who govern, as well as by the\nlicentiousness of those who are to obey . For instance: wherea s all writers\nand reasoners have agreed, that there is a strict universal resemblance\nbetween the natural and the political body; can there be any thing more\nevident, than that the health of both must be preserved, and the diseases\ncured, by the same prescriptions? It is allowed, that senates and great\ncouncils are often troubled with redundant, ebullient, and other peccant\nhumours; with many diseases of the head, and more of the heart;",
    "y the same prescriptions? It is allowed, that senates and great\ncouncils are often troubled with redundant, ebullient, and other peccant\nhumours; with many diseases of the head, and more of the heart; with\nstrong convulsions, with grievous contractions of the nerves and sinews in\nboth hands, but especially the right; with spleen, flatus, vertigos, anddeliriums; with scrofulous tumo urs, full of fetid purulent matte r; with sour\nfrothy ructations: with canine appetites, and crudeness of digestion, besides\nmany others, needless to ment ion. This doctor therefore proposed, “that\nupon the meetin g of the senate, certain physicians should attend it the three\nfirst days of their sitting, and at the close of each day’s debate feel the\npulses of every senator; after which, having maturely considered and\nconsulted upon the nature of the several maladies, and the methods of cure,\nthey should on the fourth day return to the senate house, attended by their\napothecaries stored with proper medicines",
    "ed and\nconsulted upon the nature of the several maladies, and the methods of cure,\nthey should on the fourth day return to the senate house, attended by their\napothecaries stored with proper medicines; and before the members sat,\nadminister to each of them lenitives, aperitives, abstersives, corrosives,\nrestringents, palliatives, laxatives, cephalalgics, icterics, apop hlegmatics,\nacoustics, as their several cases required; and, according as these medicines\nshould operate, repeat, alter , or omit them, at the next meeting.”\nThis project could not be of any great expense to the public; and might in\nmy poor opinion, be of much use for the despatch of busine ss, in those\ncountries where senates have any share in the legislative power; beget\nunanimity , shorten debates, open a few mouths which are now closed, and\nclose many more which are now open; curb the petulancy of the young, and\ncorrect the positiveness of the old; rouse the stupid, and damp the pert.\nAgain, because it is a general c",

    "“that every senator in the great council of a nation,\nafter he had delivered his opinion, and argued in the defence of it, should be\nobliged to give his vote directly contrary; because if that were done, the\nresult would infallibly terminate in the good of the public.”\nWhen parties in a state are violent, he offered a wonderful contrivance to\nreconcile them. The method is this: You take a hundred leaders of each\nparty; you dispose them into couples of such whose heads are nearest of a\nsize; then let two nice operators saw off the occiput of each couple at thesame time, in such a manner that the brain may be equally divided. Let the\nocciputs, thus cut off, be interchanged, applying each to the head of his\nopposite party-man. It seems indeed to be a work that requires some\nexactness, but the professor assured us, “that if it were dexterously\nperformed, the cure would be infallible.” For he argued thus: “that the two\nhalf brains being left to debate  the matter between themselves within t",

The first affirmed, “the justest method would be, to lay\na certain  tax upon vices and folly; and the sum fixed upon every man to be\nrated, after the fairest manner , by a jury of his neighbours.” The second was",
    "ffirmed, “the justest method would be, to lay\na certain  tax upon vices and folly; and the sum fixed upon every man to be\nrated, after the fairest manner , by a jury of his neighbours.” The second was\nof an opinion directly contrary; “to tax those qualities of body and mind, for\nwhich men chiefly value themselves; the rate to be more or less, according\nto the degrees of excelling; the decision whereof should be left entirely to\ntheir own breast.” The highest tax was upon men who are the greatest\nfavourites of the other sex, and the assessments, according to the number\nand nature of the favours they have received; for which, they are allowed to\nbe their own vouchers. Wit, valour , and politeness, were likewise proposed\nto be largely taxed, and collected in the same manner , by every person’ s\ngiving his own word for the quantum of what he possessed . But as to\nhonour , justice,  wisdom, and learning, they should not be taxed at all;\nbecause they are qualifications of so singular a kind,",

But as to\nhonour , justice,  wisdom, and learning, they should not be taxed at all;\nbecause they are qualifications of so singular a kind, that no man will either\nallow them in his neighbour or value them in himself.\nThe women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and skill\nin dressing, wherein they had the same privilege with the men, to be\ndetermined by their own judgment. But constancy , chastity , good sense, and\ngood nature, were not rated, because they would not bear the charge of\ncollecting.\nTo keep senators in the interest of the crown, it was proposed that the\nmembers should raffle for employments; every man first taking an oath, andgiving security , that he would vote for the court, whether he won or not;\nafter which, the losers had, in their turn, the liberty of raffling upon the next\nvacancy .

Thus, hope and expe ctation would be kept alive; none would\ncomplain of broken promises, but impute their disappointments wholly to\nfortune, whose shoulders are broader and stronger than those of a ministry .\nAnother profes sor showed me a large paper of instructions for\ndiscovering plots and conspiracies against the government. He advised\ngreat statesmen to examine into the diet of all suspected persons; their times\nof eating ; upon which side they lay in bed; with which hand they wipe their\nposteriors; take a strict view of their excrements, and, from the colour , the\nodour , the taste, the consistence, the crudeness or maturity of digestion,\nform a judgmen t of their thoug hts and designs; because men are never so\nserious, thoughtful, and intent, as when they are at stool, which he found by\nfrequent experiment; for, in such conjunctures, when he used, merely as a\ntrial, to consider which was",

This I ventured to tell the author , and offered, if he\npleased, to supply him with some additions. He received my proposition\nwith more compliance than is usual among writers, especially those of the\nprojecting species, professing “he would be glad to receive further\ninformation.”\nI told him, “that in the kingdo m of Tribnia,[454a] by the natives called\nLangden,[454b] where I had sojourned some time in my travels, the bulk of\nthe peop le consist",

The plots, in that\nkingdom, are usually the workmanship of those persons who desire to raise\ntheir own characters of profou nd politicians; to restore new vigour to a\ncrazy administration; to stifle or divert general discontents; to fill their\ncoffers with forfeitures; and raise, or sink the opinion of public credit, as\neither shall best answer their private advantage.

It is first agreed and settled\namong them, what suspected persons shall be accused of a plot; then,effectual care is taken to secure all their letters and papers, and put the\nowners in chains. These pape rs are delivered to a set of artists, very\ndexterous in finding out the mysterious meanings of words, syllables, and\nletters: for instance, they can discover a close stool, to signify a privy\ncouncil; a flock of geese, a senate; a lame dog, an invader; a codshead; a\n——; the plague , a standing army; a buzzard, a prime minister; the gout, a\nhigh priest; a gibbet, a secretar y of state; a chamber pot, a committee of\ngrandees; a sieve, a court lady; a broom, a revolution; a mouse-trap, an\nemployment; a bottomless pit, a treasury; a sink, a court; a cap and bells, a\nfavourite; a broken reed, a court of justice; an empty tun, a general; a\nrunning sore, the administration.[455]\n“When this method fails, they have two others more effectual, which the\nlearned",

First, they can decipher all\ninitial letters into political meanings. Thus N. shall signify a plot; B. a\nregiment of horse; L. a fleet at sea; or, secondly , by transposing the letters of\nthe alphabet in any suspected paper , they can lay open the deep est designs\nof a discontented party . So, for example, if I should say, in a letter to a\nfriend, ‘Our brother Tom has just got the piles,’  a skilful decipherer would\ndiscover , that the same letters which compose that sentence, may be\nanalysed into the following words, ‘Resist, a plot is brought  home; The\ntour.’ And this is the anagrammatic method.”\nThe professor made me great acknowledgments for communicating these\nobservations, and promised to make honourable mention of me in his\ntreatise.\nI saw n",

No ship\nready . He takes a short voyage to Glubbdubdrib. His\nreception by the governor .\nThe continent, of which this kingdom is a part, extends itself, as I have\nreason to believe, eastward, to that unknown tract of America westward of\nCalifornia; and north, to the Pacific Ocean, which is not above a hundred\nand fifty miles from Lagado;  where there is a good port, and much\ncommerce with the great island of Luggnagg, situated to the north-west\nabout 29 degrees north latitude, and 140 longitude.

There is a\nstrict alliance between the Japanese emperor and the king of Luggnagg;\nwhich affords frequent opportun ities of sailing from one island to the other .\nI determined therefore to direct  my course this way, in order to direct my\nreturn to Europe. I hired two mules, with a guide, to show me the way, and\ncarry my small baggage. I took leave of my noble protector , who had shown\nme so much favour , and made me a generous present at my departure.\nMy journey was without any accident or adventure worth relating. When\nI arrived at the port of Maldonada (for so it is called) there was no ship in\nthe harbour boun d for Luggnagg, nor likely to be in some time. The town is\nabout as large as Portsmouth.

It is about one third as large as the Isle of Wight,\nand extremely fruitful: it is governed by the head of a certain tribe, who are\nall magicians. This tribe marries only among each other , and the eldest insuccession is prince or governor .

He has a noble palace, and a park of about\nthree thousand acres, surrounde d by a wall of hewn stone twen ty feet high.\nIn this park are several small enclosures for cattle, corn, and gardening.\nThe governor and his family are served and attended by dome stics of a\nkind somewhat unusual. By his skill in necromancy he has a power of\ncalling whom he pleases from the dead, and commanding their service for\ntwenty-four hours, but no longer; nor can he call the same persons up again\nin less than three months, except upon very extraordinary occasions.\nWhen we arrive d at the island, which was about eleven in the morning,\none of the gentlemen who accompanied me went to the governor , and\ndesired admittance for a stranger , who came on purpose to have the honour\nof atten ding on his highness.

This was immediately granted, and we all\nthree entered the gate of the palace between two rows of guards, armed and\ndressed after a very antic manner , and with something in their countenances\nthat made my flesh creep with a horror I cannot express. We passed through\nseveral apartmen ts, between servants of the same sort, ranked on each side\nas before, till we came to the chamber of presence; where, after three\nprofound obeisances, and a few general questions, we were permitted to sit\non three stools, near the lowest step of his highness’ s throne. He understood\nthe language of Balnibarbi, altho ugh it was different from that of this island.\nHe desir ed me to give him some account of my travels; and, to let me see\nthat I should be treated without ceremony , he dismissed all his attendants\nwith a turn of his finger; at whic h, to my great astonishment, they vanished\nin an instant, like visions in a dream when we",
    "that I should be treated without ceremony , he dismissed all his attendants\nwith a turn of his finger; at whic h, to my great astonishment, they vanished\nin an instant, like visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden. I could\nnot recover myself in some time, till the governor assured me, “that I should\nreceive no hurt;” and observing my two companions to be under no\nconcern, who had been often entertained in the same manner , I began to\ntake courage, and related to his highness a short history of my several\nadventures; yet not without some hesitation, and frequently looking behind\nme to the place where I had seen those domestic spectres. I had the honour\nto dine with the governor , where a new set of ghosts served up the meat,\nand waited at table. I now observed myself to be less terrified  than I had\nbeen in the morning. I stayed till sunset, but humbly desired his highness to\nexcuse me for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace. My two\nfriends and I lay at a private ",

My two\nfriends and I lay at a private house in the town adjoining, which is the\ncapital of this little island; and the next morning we returned to pay our\nduty to the governor , as he was pleased to command us.After this mann er we continued in the island for ten days, most part of\nevery day with the governor , and at night in our lodging. I soon grew so\nfamiliarized to the sight of spirits, that after the third or fourth time they\ngave me no emotion at all: or, if I had any apprehensions left, my curiosity\nprevailed over them. For his highness the governor ordered me “to call up\nwhatever persons I would choose to name, and in whatever numbers,\namong all the dead from the beginning of the world to the present time, and\ncommand them to answer any questions I should think fit to ask; with this\ncondition, that my questions must b",

And one thing I might depend upon, that they would\ncertainly tell me the truth, for lying was a talent of no use in the lower\nworld.”\nI made my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great a\nfavour . We were in a chamber , from whence there was a fair prospect into\nthe park. And because my first inclination was to be entertained with scenes\nof pomp and magnificence, I desired to see Alexander the Great  at the head\nof his army , just after the battle of Arbela: which, upon a motion of the\ngovernor ’s finger , immediately appeared in a large field, under the window\nwhere we stood. Alexander was called up into the room: it was with great\ndifficulty that I understood his Greek, and had but little of my own. He\nassured me upon hi",

He\nassured me upon his honour “that he was not poisoned, but died of a bad\nfever by excessive drinking.”\nNext, I saw Hannibal passing the Alps, who told me “he had not a drop of\nvinegar in his camp.”\nI saw Cæsar and Pompey at the head of their troops, just ready to engage.\nI saw the former , in his last great triumph. I desired that the senate of Rome\nmight appear before me, in one large chamber , and an assembly of\nsomewhat a later age in counter view , in another . The first seem ed to be an\nassembly of heroes and demigods; the other , a knot of pedlars, pick-\npockets, highwaymen, and bullies.\nThe governor , at my request, gave the sign for Cæsar and Brutus to\nadvance towards us.

I\nobserved, with much pleasure , that these two persons were in goodintelligence with each other; and Cæsar freely confessed to me, “that the\ngreatest actions of his own life were not equal, by many degrees, to the\nglory of taking it away .” I had the honour to have much conversation with\nBrutus; and was told, “that his ancestor Junius, Socrates, Epaminondas,\nCato the younger , Sir Thomas More, and himself were perpetually\ntogether:” a sextumvirate, to which all the ages of the world cannot add a\nseventh.\nIt would be tedious to trouble the reader with relating what vast numbers\nof illustr ious persons were called up to gratify that insatiable desi",

But it is impossible to\nexpress the satisfaction I receive d in my own mind, after such a manner as\nto make it a suitable entertainment to the reader .CHAPTER VIII.\nA further account of Glubbdubdrib. Ancient and modern\nhistory corrected.\nHaving a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit\nand learning, I set apart one day on purpose.

    "e might appear at the head of all their commentators; but these were\nso numerous, that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court, and\noutward rooms of the palace. I knew , and could distinguish those two\nheroes, at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other . Homer\nwas the taller and comelier person of the two, walked very erect for one of\nhis age, and his eyes were the most quick and piercing I ever beheld.\nAristotle stooped much, and made use of a staff. His visage was meagre, his\nhair lank and thin, and his voice  hollow . I soon discovered that both of them\nwere perfect strangers to the rest of the company , and had never seen or\nheard of them before; and I had a whisper from a ghost who shall be\nnameless, “that these commentators always kept in the most distant quarters\nfrom their principals, in the lower world, through a consciousness of shame\nand guilt, because they had so horribly misrepresented the meaning of those\nauthors to posterity .” I introduc ed Di",
    "uarters\nfrom their principals, in the lower world, through a consciousness of shame\nand guilt, because they had so horribly misrepresented the meaning of those\nauthors to posterity .” I introduc ed Didymus and Eustathius to Homer , and\nprevailed on him to treat them better than perhaps they deserved, for he\nsoon found they wanted a genius to enter into the spirit of a poet. But\nAristotle was out of all patience with the account I gave him of Scotus and\nRamus, as I presented them to him; and he asked them, “whether the rest of\nthe tribe were as great dunces as themselves?”\nI then desired the governor to call up Descartes and Gassendi, with whom\nI prevailed to explain their systems to Aristotle. This great philosopher\nfreely acknowle dged his own mistakes in natural philosophy , because he\nproceeded in many things upon conjecture, as all men must do; and he\nfound that Gassendi, who had made the doctrine of Epicurus as palatable as\nhe could , and the vortices  of Descartes, were equally t",

He\npredicted the same fate to attraction , whereo f the present learned are suchzealous asserter s. He said, “that new systems of nature were but new\nfashions, which would vary in every age; and even those, who pretend to\ndemonstrate them from mathematical principles, would flourish but a short\nperiod of time, and be out of vogue when that was determined.”\nI spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned. I\nsaw most of the first Roman emperors. I prevailed on the governor to call\nup Heliogabalus’ s cooks to dress us a dinner , but they could not show us\nmuch of their skill, for want of materials.

But my disappointment was grievous\nand unexpected.  For, instead of a long train with royal diadems, I saw in\none family two fiddlers, three spruce courtiers, and an Italian  prelate.

But as to\ncounts, marquises, dukes, earls, and the like, I was not so scrupu lous. And I\nconfess, it was not without some pleasure, that I found myself able to trace\nthe particular features, by which certain families are distinguished, up to\ntheir originals. I could plainly discover whence one family derives a long\nchin; why a second has abounded with knaves for two generations, and\nfools for two more; why a third happened to be crack-brained, and a fourth\nto be sharpers; whence it came, what Polydore Virgil says of a certain great\nhouse, Nec vir fortis , nec femina casta ; how cruelty , falsehood, and\ncowardice, grew to be characteristics by which certain families are\ndistinguished as much as by their coats of arms; who first brought the pox\ninto a noble house, which has lineally descended scrofulous tumours to\ntheir posterity .

Neither could I wonder at all this, when I saw such an\ninterruption of lineages, by pages, lackeys, valets, coachmen, gamesters,\nfiddlers, players, captains, and pickpockets.\nI was chiefly disgusted with modern history . For having strictly examined\nall the persons of greatest name in the courts of princes, for a hundred yearspast, I found how the world had been misled by prostitute writer s, to ascribe\nthe greatest exploits in war, to cowards; the wisest counsel, to fools;\nsincerity , to flatterers; Roman virtue, to betrayers of their country; piety , to\natheists; chastity , to sodomites; truth, to informers: how many innocent and\nexcellent persons had been condemned to death or banishment by the\npractising of great ministers upon the corruption of judges, and the malice\nof factions: how many vill",

How low an opinion I had of human\nwisdom and integrity , when I was truly informed of the springs and motives\nof great enterprises and revolutions in the world, and of the contemptible\naccidents to which they owed their success.\nHere I discovered the roguery and ignorance of those who pretend to\nwrite anecdotes, or secret history; who send so many kings to their graves\nwith a cup of poison; will repea t the discourse between a princ e and chief\nminister , where no witness was by; unlock the thoughts and cabinets of\nambassadors and secretaries of state; and have ",

Here I discovered the true causes of many great events that\nhave surprised the world; how a whore can govern the back-stairs, the back-\nstairs a council, and the council a senate. A general confessed, in my\npresence, “that he got a victory purely by the force of cowardice and ill\nconduct;” and an admiral, “that,  for want of proper intelligence,  he beat the\nenemy , to whom  he intended to betray the fleet.” Three kings protested to\nme, “that in their whole reigns they never did once prefer any person of\nmerit, unless by mistake, or treachery of some minister in whom they\nconfided; neithe r would they do it if they were to live again:” and they\nshowed, with great strength of reason, “that the royal throne could not be\nsupported witho ut corruption, ",

    "concerned were called up; and, upon a\nvery slight examination, discovered such a scene of infamy , that I cannot\nreflect upon it without some seriousness. Perjury , oppression, subornation,\nfraud, pandarism, and the like infirmities, were among the most excusable\narts they had to mention; and for these I gave, as it was reasonable, great\nallowance. But when some confessed they owed their greatness and wealth\nto sodomy , or incest; others, to the prostituting of their own wives and\ndaughters; others, to the betraying of their country or their prince; some, to\npoisoning; more to the perverting of justice, in order to destroy the\ninnocent, I hope I may be pardoned, if these discoveries inclined me a little\nto abate  of that profound vene ration, which I am naturally apt to pay to\npersons of high rank, who ought  to be treated with the utmost respect due to\ntheir sublime dignity , by us their inferiors.\nI had often read of some great services done to princes and states, and\ndesired to see ",

Upon\ninquiry I was told, “that their names were to be found on no record, except a\nfew of them, whom history has represented as the vilest of rogues and\ntraitors.” As to the rest, I had never once heard of them. They all appeared\nwith dejected looks, and in the meanest habit; most of them  telling me,\n“they died in poverty and disgrace, and the rest on a scaf fold or a gibbet.”\nAmong others, there was one person, whose case appeared a little\nsingular . He had a youth about eighteen years old standing by his side. He\ntold me, “he had for many years been commander of a ship; and in the sea\nfight at Actium had the good fortune to break through the enemy’ s great line\nof battle, sink three of their capital ships, and take a fourth, which was ",

Returning back\nto his own vessel, he was charged with neglect of duty, and the ship given\nto a favourite page of Publicola, the vice-admiral; whereupon he retired to a\npoor farm at a great distance from Rome, and there ended his life.” I was so\ncurious to know the truth of this story , that I ",

He appeared, and confirmed thewhole account: but with much more advantage to the captain, whose\nmodesty had extenuated or concealed a great part of his merit.\nI was surprised to find corruption grown so high and so quick in that\nempire, by the force of luxury so lately introduced; which made me less\nwonder at many parallel cases in other countries, where vices of all kinds\nhave reigned so much longer , and where the whole praise, as well as\npillage, has been engrossed by the chief commander , who perhaps had the\nleast title to either .\nAs every person called up made exactly the same appearance he had\ndone in the world, it gave me melancholy reflections to observe how much\nthe race of humankind was degenerated among us within t",

Sails to the kingdom of\nLuggnagg. The author confined . He is sent for to court. The\nmanner of his admittance. The king’ s great lenity to his\nsubjects.\nThe day of our departure being come, I took leave of his highness, the\nGovernor of Glubbdubdrib, and returned with my two companions to\nMaldonada, where, after a fortn ight’s waiting, a ship was ready to sail for\nLuggnagg. The two gentlemen, and some others, were so genero us and kind\nas to furnish me with provisions, and see me on board. I was a month in this\nvoyage.

    "sh me with provisions, and see me on board. I was a month in this\nvoyage. We had one violent storm, and were under a necessity of steering\nwestward to get into the trade wind, which holds for above sixty leagues.\nOn the 21st of April, 1708, we sailed into the river of Clumegnig , which is a\nseaport town, at the south-east point of Luggnagg. We cast anch or within a\nleague of the town, and made a signal for a pilot. Two of them came on\nboard in less than half an hour, by whom we were guided betw een certain\nshoals and rocks, which are very dangerous in the passage, to a large basin,\nwhere a fleet may ride in safety within a cable’ s length of the town-wall.\nSome of our sailors, whether out of treachery or inadvertence, had\ninformed the pilots “that I was a stranger , and great traveller;” whereof\nthese gave notic e to a custom-ho use officer, by whom I was examined very\nstrictly upon my landing.

    "hereof\nthese gave notic e to a custom-ho use officer, by whom I was examined very\nstrictly upon my landing. This officer spoke to me in the language of\nBalnibarbi, whic h, by the force of much commerce, is generally  understood\nin that town, especially by seamen and those employed in the customs. I\ngave him a short account of some particulars, and made my story as\nplausible and consistent as I could; but I thought it necessary to disguise my\ncountry , and call myself a Hollander; because my intentions were for Japan,\nand I knew the Dutch were the only Europeans permitted to enter into that\nkingdom. I therefore told the officer, “that having been shipwrecked on the\ncoast of Balniba rbi, and cast on a rock, I was received up into Laputa, or the\nflying island (of which he had often heard), and was now endeavouring toget to Japan, whence I might find a convenience of returning  to my own\ncountry .” The officer said, “I must be confined till he could receive orders\nfrom court, for which he ",
    "d was now endeavouring toget to Japan, whence I might find a convenience of returning  to my own\ncountry .” The officer said, “I must be confined till he could receive orders\nfrom court, for which he would write immediately , and hoped to receive an\nanswer in a fortnight.” I was carried to a convenient lodging with a sentry\nplaced at the door; however , I had the liberty of a large garde n, and was\ntreated with humanity enough, being maintained all the time at the king’ s\ncharge. I was invited by several persons, chiefly out of curiosity , because it\nwas reported that I came from countries very remote, of which they had\nnever heard.\nI hired a young man, who came in the same ship, to be an interpreter; he\nwas a native of Luggnagg, but had lived some years at Maldonada, and was\na perfect master of both languages. By his assistance, I was able to hold a\nconversation with those who came to visit me; but this consisted only of\ntheir questions, and my answers.\nThe despatch came from court ab",
    "ter of both languages. By his assistance, I was able to hold a\nconversation with those who came to visit me; but this consisted only of\ntheir questions, and my answers.\nThe despatch came from court about the time we expected. It contained a\nwarrant for conducting me and my retinue to Traldragdubh , or Trildrogdrib\n(for it is pronounced both ways as near as I can remember), by a party of\nten horse. All my retinue was that poor lad for an interpreter , whom I\npersuaded into my service, and, at my humble request, we had each of us a\nmule to ride on. A messenger was despatched half a day’s journey before us,\nto give the king notice of my approach, and to desire, “that his majesty\nwould please to appoint a day and hour, when it would by his gracious\npleasure that I might have the honour to lick the dust before his footstool.”\nThis is the court style, and I found it to be more than matter of form: for,\nupon my admitt ance two days after my arrival, I was command ed to crawl\nupon my belly , a",

How ever, this was a peculiar grace, not allowed to any but\npersons of the highest rank, when they desire an admittance. Nay,\nsometimes the floor is strewed with dust on purpose, when the person to be\nadmitted happen s to have powerful enemies at court; and I have seen a great\nlord with his mouth so crammed, that when he had crept to the proper\ndistance from the throne; he was not able to speak a word. Neither is there\nany remedy; because it is capital for those who receive an audience to spit\nor wipe  their mouths in his majesty’ s presence.

    "ital for those who receive an audience to spit\nor wipe  their mouths in his majesty’ s presence. There is indeed another\ncustom, which I cannot altogeth er approve of: when the king has a mind to\nput any of his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner , he commandsthe floor to be strewed with a certain brown powder of a deadly\ncomposition, which being licked up, infallibly kills him in twenty-four\nhours. But in justice to this prince’ s great clemency , and the care he has of\nhis subje cts’ lives (wherein it were much to be wished that the Monarchs of\nEurope would imitate him), it must be mentioned for his honou r, that strict\norders are given to have the infected parts of the floor well washed after\nevery such execution, which, if his domestics neglect, they are in danger of\nincurring his royal displeasure. I myself heard him give directio ns, that one\nof his pages should be whipped, whose turn it was to give notice about\nwashing the floor after an execution, but maliciously had o",

I myself heard him give directio ns, that one\nof his pages should be whipped, whose turn it was to give notice about\nwashing the floor after an execution, but maliciously had omitted it; by\nwhich neglect a young lord of great hopes, coming to an audience, was\nunfortunately poisoned, although the king at that time had no design against\nhis life. But this good prince was so gracious as to forgive the poor page his\nwhipping, upon  promise that he would do so no more, without special\norders.\nTo retur n from this digression. When I had crept within four yards of the\nthrone, I raised myself gently upon my knees, and then striking my\nforehead seven times against the ground, I pronounced the following words,\nas they had been taught me the night before, Ickpling gloffthr obb\nsquutserumm blhiop mlashnalt zwin tnodbalkguffh slhiophad gurdlubh asht.\nThis is the compliment, establis hed by the laws of the land, for all persons\nadmitted to the king’s presence.

It may be rendered into English thus: “May\nyour celestial majesty outlive the sun, eleven moons and a half!” To this the\nking returned some answer , which, although I could not understand, yet I\nreplied as I had been directed: Fluft drin yalerick dwuldom prastrad\nmirpush , which properly signifies, “My tongue is in the mouth of my\nfriend;” and by this expression was meant, that I desired leave to bring my\ninterpreter; whereupon the young man already mentioned was accordingly\nintroduced, by whose intervent ion I answered as many questions as his\nmajesty could put in above an hour.

But I thought it more consistent with prudence and\njustice to pass the remainder of my days with my wife and family .CHAPTER X.\nThe Luggnaggians commended. A particular description of\nthe Struldbrugs, with many conversations between the\nauthor and some eminent persons upon that subject.\nThe Luggnaggia ns are a polite and generous people; and altho ugh they\nare not without some share of that pride which is peculiar to all Eastern\ncountries, yet they show themselves courteous to strangers, especially such\nwho are countenanced b",

I had many acquaintance, and among\npersons of the best fashion; and being always attended by my interpreter ,\nthe conversation we had was not disagreeable.\nOne day, in much good compa ny, I was asked by a person of quality ,\n“whether I had seen any of their struldbrugs , or immortals?”  I said, “I had\nnot;” and desired he would explain to me “what he meant by such an\nappellation, applied to a mortal creature.” He told me “that sometimes,\nthough very rarely , a child happened to be born in a family , with a red\ncircular spot in the forehead, directly over the left eyebrow , which was an\ninfallible mark that it should never die.” The spot, as he described it, “was\nabout the compass of a silver threepence, but in the course of time grew\nlarger, and changed its colour; for at twel",
    "as an\ninfallible mark that it should never die.” The spot, as he described it, “was\nabout the compass of a silver threepence, but in the course of time grew\nlarger, and changed its colour; for at twelve years old it became green, so\ncontinued till five and twenty , then turned to a deep blue: at five and forty it\ngrew coal black, and as large as an English shilling; but never admitted any\nfurther alteratio n.” He said, “these births were so rare, that he did not\nbelieve there could be above eleven hundred struldbrugs, of both sexes, in\nthe whole kingdom; of which he computed about fifty in the metropolis,\nand, among the rest, a young girl born about three years ago: that these\nproductions were not peculiar to any family , but a mere effect of chance;\nand the children of the struldbrugs  themselves were equally mortal  with the\nrest of the people.”\nI freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight, upon\nhearing this account: and the person who gave it me happening to\nun",
    "emselves were equally mortal  with the\nrest of the people.”\nI freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight, upon\nhearing this account: and the person who gave it me happening to\nunderstand the Balnibarbian language, which I spoke very well,  I could notforbear breaking  out into expressions, perhaps a little too extravagant. I\ncried out, as in a rapture, “Happy nation, where every child hath at least a\nchance for being immortal! Happy people, who enjoy so many living\nexamples of ancient virtue, and have masters ready to instruct them in the\nwisdom of all former ages! but happiest, beyond all comparison, are those\nexcellent struldbrugs , who, being born exempt from that universal calamity\nof human nature, have their minds free and disengaged, without the weight\nand depression of spirits caused by the continual apprehensions of death!” I\ndiscovered my admiration, “that  I had not observed any of these illustrious\npersons at court; the black spot on the forehead being ",
    "ssion of spirits caused by the continual apprehensions of death!” I\ndiscovered my admiration, “that  I had not observed any of these illustrious\npersons at court; the black spot on the forehead being so remarkable a\ndistinction, that I could not have easily overlooked it: and it was impossible\nthat his majesty , a most judiciou s prince, should not provide himself with a\ngood number of such wise and able counsellors. Yet perhaps the virtue of\nthose reverend sages was too strict for the corrupt and libertine  manners of\na court: and we often find by experience, that young men are too\nopinionated and volatile to be guided by the sober dictates of their seniors.\nHowever , since the king was pleased to allow me access to his royal person,\nI was resolved, upon the very first occasion, to deliver my opinion to him\non this matter freely and at large, by the help of my interpreter; and whether\nhe would please to take my advice or not, yet in one thing I was determined,\nthat his majesty  having",

After a short silence, the same person told me,\n“that his friends and mine (so he thought fit to express himself ) were very\nmuch pleased with the judicious remarks I had made on the great happiness\nand advantages of immortal life, and they were desirous to know , in a\nparticular manne r, what scheme of living I should have formed to myself, if\nit had fallen to my lot to have been born a struldbrug .”I answered, “it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and delightful a\nsubject, especia lly to me, who had been often apt to amuse myself with\nvisions of what I should do, if I were a king, a general, or a great lord: and\nupon this very case, I had frequently run over the whole system how I\nshould employ myself, and pass the time, if I were sure to live for ever .\n“That, if it had been my good fortune to come into the worl",

In the pursuit\nof which, by thrift and manage ment, I might reasonably expect, in about\ntwo hundred years, to be the wealthiest man in the kingdom. In the second\nplace, I would, from my earliest  youth, apply myself to the study of arts and\nsciences, by which I should arrive in time to excel all others in learning.\nLastly , I would carefully record every action and event of consequence, that\nhappened in the public, impartially draw the characters of the several\nsuccessions of princes and great ministers of state, with my own\nobservations on every point.

I would exactly set down the several changes\nin customs, language, fashions of dress, diet, and diversions. By all which\nacquirements, I should be a living treasure of knowledge and wisdom, and\ncertainly become the oracle of the nation.\n“I would  never marry after threescore, but live in a hospitable manner ,\nyet still on the saving side. I would entertain myself in forming and\ndirecting the minds of hopeful young men, by convincing them, from my\nown remembran ce, experience , and observation, fortified by numerous\nexamples, of the usefulness of virtue in public and private life.

I\nshould then see the discovery of the longitude, the perpetual motion, the\nuniversal medic ine, and many other great inventions, brought to the utmost\nperfection.\n“What wonderful discoveries should we make in astronomy , by outliving\nand confirming our own predic tions; by observing the progress and return\nof",

When I had\nended, and the sum of my discourse had been interpreted, as before, to the\nrest of the company , there was a good deal of talk among them in the\nlanguage of the country , not without some laughter at my expense. At last,\nthe same gentleman who had been my interpreter , said, “he was desired by\nthe rest to set me right in a few mistakes, which I had fallen into through the\ncommon imbecility of human nature, and upon that allowance was less\nanswerable for them.

That whoever had one foot in the grave was sure to\nhold back the other as strongly as he could. That the oldest had still hopesof living one day longer , and looked on death as the greatest evil, from\nwhich nature always prompted  him to retreat.

For although few men will avow their desires of\nbeing immortal,  upon such hard conditions, yet in the two kingdoms before\nmentioned, of Balnibarbi and Japan, he observed that every man desired to\nput off death some time longer , let it approach ever so late: an",

And he appealed to me, whether in those\ncountries I had travelled, as well as my own, I had not observ ed the same\ngeneral disposition.”\nAfter this preface, he gave me a particular account of the struldbrugs\namong them. He said, “they commonly acted like mortals till about thirty\nyears old; after which, by degrees, they grew melancholy and dejected,\nincreasing in both till they came to fourscore. This he learned from their\nown confession: for otherwise, there not being above two or three of that\nspecies born in an age, they were too few to form a general observation by.\nWhen they came to fourscore years, which is reckoned the extremity of\nliving in this country , they had not only",

They were not only opinionative, peevish, covetous, morose,\nvain, talkative, but incapable of friendship, and dead to all natural affection,\nwhich never descended below their grandchildren. Envy and impotent\ndesires are their prevailing passions. But those objects against which their\nenvy seems principally directed, are the vices of the younger sort and the\ndeaths of the old. By reflecting on the former , they find themse lves cut off\nfrom all possibility of pleasure; and whenever they see a funeral, they\nlament and repine that others have gone to a harbour of rest to which they\nthemselves never can hope to arrive.

He\nlikewise present ed me with four hundred and forty-four large pieces of gold\n(this nation delighting in even numbers), and a red diamond, which I sold in\nEngland for eleven hundred pounds.\nOn the 6th day of May, 1709, I took a solemn leave of his majesty, and\nall my friends. This prince was so gracious as to order a guard to conduct\nme to Glanguenstald, which is a royal port to the south-west part of the\nisland. In six days I found a vessel ready to carry me to Japan, and spent\nfifteen days in the voyage.

At landing,\nI showed the custom-house officers my letter from the king of Luggnagg to\nhis imperial majesty . They knew the seal perfectly well; it was as broad as\nthe palm  of my hand. The impre ssion was, A king lifting up a lame beggar\nfrom the earth . The magistrates of the town, hearing of my letter , received\nme as a public minister . They provided me with carriages and servants, and\nbore my charges to Yedo; where I was admitted to an audience, and\ndelivered my letter , which was opened with great ceremony , and explained\nto the Emperor by an interpreter , who then gave me notice, by his majesty’ s\norder , “that I should signify my request, and, whatever it were, it should be\ngranted, for the sake of his royal  brother of Luggnagg.” This interpreter was\na perso n employed to transact af",

He soon\nconjectured, by my countenance, that I was a European, and therefore\nrepeated his majesty’ s command s in Low Dutch, which he spoke perfectly\nwell. I answered, as I had before determined, “that I was a Dutc h merchant,\nshipwrecked in a very remote country , whence I had travelled  by sea and\nland to Luggnagg, and then took shipping for Japan; where I knew my\ncountrymen often traded, and with some of these I hoped to get an\nopportunity of returning into Europe: I therefore most humbly entreated his\nroyal favour , to give order that I should be conducted in safety to\nNangasac.” To this I added another petition, “that for the sake of my patron\nthe king of Luggnagg, his majesty would condescend to excuse my\nperforming the ceremony imposed on my countrymen, of",
    "ety to\nNangasac.” To this I added another petition, “that for the sake of my patron\nthe king of Luggnagg, his majesty would condescend to excuse my\nperforming the ceremony imposed on my countrymen, of trampling upon\nthe crucifix, because I had been thrown into his kingdom by my\nmisfortunes, without any intenti on of trading.” When this latter petition was\ninterpreted to the Emperor , he seemed a little surprised; and said, “he\nbelieved I was the first of my countrymen who ever made any scruple in\nthis point; and that he began to doubt, whether I was a real Hollander , or\nnot; but rather suspected I must be a Christian. However , for the reasons I\nhad offered, but chiefly to gratify the king of Luggnagg by an uncommon\nmark of his favour , he would comply with the singularity of my humour;\nbut the affair must be managed with dexterity , and his officers should be\ncommanded to let me pass, as it were by forgetfulness.

For he assured me,\nthat if the secret should be discovered by my countrymen the Dutch, they\nwould cut my throat in the voyage.” I returned my thanks, by the\ninterpreter , for so unusual a favour; and some troops being at that time ontheir march to Nangasac, the commanding officer had orders to convey me\nsafe thither , with particular instructions about the business of the crucifix.\nOn the 9th day of June, 1709, I arrived at Nangasac, after a very long and\ntroublesome journey . I soon fell into the company of some Dutch sailors\nbelonging to the Amboyna, of Amsterdam, a stout ship of 450 tons.

I made up a story as short and\nprobable as I could, but conceale d the greatest part. I knew many persons in\nHolland. I was able to invent names for my parents, whom I pretended to be\nobscure people in the province of Gelderland. I would have given the\ncaptain (one Theodorus Vangrul t) what he pleased to ask for my voyage to\nHolland; but understanding I was a surgeon, he was contented to take half\nthe usual rate, on condition that I would serve him in the way of my calling.\nBefore we took shipping, I was often asked by some of the crew , whether I\nhad performed the ceremony above mentioned. I evaded the question by\ngeneral answer s; “that I had satisfied the Emperor and court in all\nparticulars.” However , a malici ous rogue of a skipper went to an officer,\nand pointing to me, told him, “I had not yet trampled on the crucifix;” but\nthe other , who had received inst",

We set sail from  Portsmouth upon the 7th day of August,\n1710; on the 14th we met with Captain Pocock, of Bristol, at Tenerif fe, who\nwas going to the bay of Camp echy to cut logwood. On the 16th, he was\nparted from us by a storm; I heard since my return, that his ship foundered,\nand none escaped but one cabin boy. He was an honest man, and a good\nsailor , but a little too positive in his own opinions, which was the cause of\nhis destruction, as it has been with several others; for if he had followed my\nadvice, he might have been safe at home with his family at this time, as well\nas myself.\nI had several men who died in my ship of calentures, so that I was for",

I had fifty hands on board; and my orders were, that I should\ntrade with the Indians in the South-Sea, and make what discoveries I could.\nThese rogues, whom I had picked up, debauched my other men, and they all\nformed a conspiracy to seize the ship, and secure me; which they did one\nmorning, rushing into my cabin, and binding me hand and foot, threateningto throw  me overboard, if I offered to stir. I told them, “I was their prisoner ,\nand would submit.” This they made me swear to do, and then they unbound\nme, only fastening one of my legs with a chain, near",

They sent me down victuals and drink, and\ntook the government of the ship to themselves. Their design was to turn\npirates, and plunder the Spaniards, which they could not do till they got\nmore men. But first they resolved to sell the goods in the ship, and then go\nto Madagascar for recruits, several among them having died since my\nconfinement. They sailed many weeks, and traded with the Indians; but I\nknew not what course they took, being kept a close prisoner in my cabin,\nand expecting nothing less than to be murdered, as they often threatened\nme.\nUpon the 9th day of May, 1711, one James Welch came down to my\ncabin, and said, “he had orders from the captain to se",

They forced me into the long-boat, letting me\nput on my best suit of clothes, which were as good as new, and take a small\nbundle of linen,  but no arms, except my hanger; and they were  so civil as\nnot to search my pockets, into which I conveyed what money I had, with\nsome other little necessaries. They rowed about a league, and then set me\ndown on a strand. I desired them to tell me what country it was. They all\nswore, “they knew no more than myself;” but said, “that the captain” (as\nthey called him) “was resolved, after they had sold the lading, to get rid of\nme in the first place where they could discover land.” They pushed off\nimmediately , advising me to make haste for fe",

When I was a little refreshed, I went up into the countr y, resolving\nto deliver myself to the first savages I should meet, and purch ase my life\nfrom them by some bracelets, glass rings, and other toys, which sailors\nusually provide themselves with in those voyages, and whereof  I had some\nabout me. The land was divided by long rows of trees, not regularly planted,\nbut naturally growing; there was great plenty of grass, and several fields of\noats.

I fell into a beaten road,where I saw many tracts of human feet, and some of cows, but most of\nhorses. At last I beheld several animals in a field, and one or two of the\nsame kind sitting in trees. Their shape was very singular and deformed,\nwhich a little discomposed me, so that I lay down behind a thicket to\nobserve them better . Some of them coming forward near the place where I\nlay, gave me an opportunity of distinctly marking their form. Their heads\nand breasts were covered with a thick hair, some frizzled, and others lank;\nthey had beards  like goats, and a long ridge of hair down their backs, and\nthe fore parts of their legs and feet; but the rest of their bodies was bare, so\nthat I might see their skins, which were of a brown buff colour .

They climbed high trees as nimbly as a squirrel, for they had\nstrong extended claws before and behind, terminating in sharp points, and\nhooked. They would often spring, and bound, and leap, with prodigious\nagility . The females were not so large as the males; they had long lank hair\non their heads, but none on their faces, nor any thing more than a sort of\ndown on the rest of their bodie s, except about the anus and pudenda.

So that, thinking I had seen enough, full of contempt\nand aversion, I got up, and pursued the beaten road, hoping it might direct\nme to the cabin of some Indian.  I had not got far, when I met one of these\ncreatures full in my way, and coming up directly to me. The ugly monster ,\nwhen he saw me, distorted several ways, every feature of his visage, and\nstared, as at an object he had never seen before; then approaching nearer ,\nlifted up his fore-paw , whether out of curiosity or mischief I could not tell;\nbut I drew my hanger , and gave him a good blow with the flat side of it, for\nI durst not strike with the edge, fearing the inhabitants migh",

When the beast felt the smart, he drew back, and roared so loud,\nthat a herd of at least forty came flocking about me from the next field,\nhowling and making odious faces; but I ran to the body of a tree, and\nleaning my back against it, kept them off by waving my hanger . Several ofthis cursed brood, getting hold of the branches behind, leaped  up into the\ntree, whence they began to dischar ge their excrements on my head;\nhowever , I escaped pretty well by sticking close to the stem of the tree, but\nwas almost stifled with the filth, which fell about me on every side.\nIn the midst of this distress, I observed them all to run away on a sudden\nas fast as they could; at which I ventured to l",

But\nlooking on my left hand, I saw a horse walking softly in the field; which my\npersecutors having sooner discovered, was the cause of their flight. The\nhorse started a little, when he came near me, but soon recover ing himself,\nlooked full in my face with manifest tokens of wonder; he viewed my hands\nand feet, walking round me several times. I would have pursued my\njourney , but he placed himself directly in the way, yet looking with a very\nmild aspect, never offering the least violence.

But this animal seemed to\nreceive my civilities with disdain, shook his head, and bent his brows, softly\nraising up his right fore-foot to remove my hand. Then he neighed three or\nfour times, but in so different a cadence, that I almost began to think he was\nspeaking to himself, in some language of his own.\nWhile he and I were thus employed, another horse came up; who\napplying himself to the first in a very formal manner , they gently struck\neach other ’s right hoof before, neighing several times by turns, and varying\nthe sound, which seemed to be almost articulate.

The gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his right\nfore-hoof, and discomposed it so much that I was forced to adjust it better\nby taking it off and settling it again; whereat, both he and his companion\n(who was a brown bay) appear ed to be much surprised: the latter felt the\nlappet of my coat, and finding it to hang loose about me, they both looked\nwith new signs of wonder .

I plainly  observed that their language expressed the\npassions very well, and the words might, with little pains, be resolved into\nan alphabet more easily than the Chinese.I could frequently distinguish the word Yahoo , which was repeated by\neach of them several times: and although it was impossible  for me to\nconjecture what it meant, yet while the two horses were busy in\nconversation, I endeavoured to practise this word upon my tongue; and as\nsoon as they were silent, I boldly pronounced Yahoo  in a loud voice,\nimitating at the same time, as near as I could, the neighing of a horse; at\nwhich they were both visibly surprised; and the gray repeate d the same\nword twice, as if he meant to teach me the right accent; wher ein I spoke\nafter him as well as I could, and found myself perceivably to improve every\ntime, though very far from any degree of perfection.

Then the bay tried me\nwith a second word, much harder to be pronounced; but reducing it to the\nEnglish orthogra phy, may be spelt thus, Houyhnhnm . I did not succe ed in\nthis so well as in the former; but after two or three farther trials, I had better\nfortune; and they both appeared amazed at my capacity .\nAfter some further discourse, which I then conjectured might relate to\nme, the two friends took their leaves, with the same compliment of striking\neach other’s hoof; and the gray made me signs that I should walk before\nhim; wherein I thought it prudent to comply , till I could find a better\ndirector . When I offered to slacken my pace, he would cry hhuun hhuun : I\nguessed his meaning, and gave him to understand, as well as I could, “that I\nwas weary, and not able to walk faster;” upon which he would stand a while\nto let me rest.CHAPTER II.\nThe autho",

The\nhouse described. The author ’s reception. The food of the\nHouyhnhnms. The author in distress for want of meat, is at\nlast relieved. His manner of feeding in this country .\nHaving travelled  about three miles, we came to a long kind of building,\nmade of timber stuck in the ground, and wattled across; the roof was low\nand covered with straw . I now began to be a little comforted; and took out\nsome toys, which travellers usually carry for presents to the savage Indians\nof America, and other parts, in hopes the people of the house would be\nthereby encouraged to receive me kindly . The horse made me a sign to go in\nfirst; it was a large room with a smooth clay floor , and a rack and manger ,\nextending the whole length on one side. There were three n",

There were three nags and two\nmares, not eating, but some of them sitting down upon their hams, which I\nvery much wondered at; but wondered more to see the rest employed in\ndomestic business; these seemed but ordinary cattle. However , this\nconfirmed my first opinion, that a people who could so far civilize brute\nanimals, must needs excel in wisdom all the nations of the world. The gray\ncame in just after, and thereby prevented any ill treatment which the others\nmight have given me. He neighed to them several times in a style of\nauthority , and received answers.\nBeyond this room there were three others, reaching the length of the\nhouse, to which  you passed through three doors, opposite to each other , in\nthe manner of a vista.

The horse neighed three or four times,\nand I waited to hear some answers in a human voice, but I heard no other\nreturns than in the same dialect , only one or two a little shrille r than his. I\nbegan to think that this house must belong to some person of great noteamong them, because there appe ared so much ceremony before I could gain\nadmittance. But, that a man of quality should be served all by horses, was\nbeyond my comprehension. I feared my brain was disturb ed by my\nsufferings and misfortunes.

    "should be served all by horses, was\nbeyond my comprehension. I feared my brain was disturb ed by my\nsufferings and misfortunes. I roused myself, and looked about me in the\nroom where I was left alone: this was furnished like the first, only after a\nmore elegant manner . I rubbed my eyes often, but the same objects still\noccurred. I pinched my arms and sides to awake myself, hoping  I might be\nin a dream. I then absolutely concluded, that all these appearances could be\nnothing else but necromancy and magic. But I had no time to pursue these\nreflections; for the gray horse came to the door, and made me a sign to\nfollow him into the third room where I saw a very comely mare, together\nwith a colt and foal, sitting on their haunches upon mats of straw , not\nunartfully made, and perfectly neat and clean.\nThe mare soon after my entrance rose from her mat, and coming up\nclose, after having nicely observed my hands and face, gave  me a most\ncontemptuous look; and turning to the horse, I heard t",

But I was\nsoon better informed, to my everlasting mortification; for the horse,\nbeckoning to me with his head,  and repeating the hhuun , hhuun , as he did\nupon the road, which I understood was to attend him, led me out into a kind\nof court, where was another building, at some distance from the house. Here\nwe entered, and I saw three of those detestable creatures, which I first met\nafter my landing, feeding upon roots, and the flesh of some animals, which\nI afterw ards found to be that of asses and dogs, and now and then a cow,\ndead by accident or disease.

They were all tied by the neck with strong\nwithes, fastened to a beam; they held their food between the claws of their\nforefeet, and tore it with their teeth.\nThe master horse ordered a sorrel nag, one of his servants, to untie the\nlargest of these animals, and take him into the yard. The beast and I were\nbrought close together , and by our countenances diligently compared both\nby master and servant, who thereupon repeated several times the word\nY ahoo . My horror and astonishment are not to be described, when I\nobserved in this abominable animal, a perfect human figure: the face of it\nindeed was flat and broad, the nose depressed, the lips large, and the mouth\nwide; but these differences are common to all savage nations, where the\nlineaments of the countenance are distorted, by the natives suffering theirinfants to lie grovelling on the earth, or by carrying them on th",
    "ese differences are common to all savage nations, where the\nlineaments of the countenance are distorted, by the natives suffering theirinfants to lie grovelling on the earth, or by carrying them on their backs,\nnuzzling with their face against the mothers’  shoulders. The forefeet of the\nY ahoo  differed from my hands in nothing else but the length of the nails, the\ncoarseness and brownness of the palms, and the hairiness on the backs.\nThere was the same resemblance between our feet, with the same\ndifferences; which I knew very well, though the horses did not, because of\nmy shoes and stockings; the same in every part of our bodies except as to\nhairiness and colour , which I have already described.\nThe great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses, was to see\nthe rest of my body so very different from that of a Y ahoo , for which I was\nobliged to my clothes, whereof they had no conception.

The sorrel nag\noffered me a root, which he held (after their manner , as we shall describe in\nits prope r place)  between his hoof and pastern; I took it in my hand, and,\nhaving smelt it, returned it to him again as civilly as I could. He brought out\nof the Y ahoos ’ kennel a piece of ass’s flesh; but it smelt so offensively that I\nturned from it with loathing: he then threw it to the Y ahoo , by whom it was\ngreedily devour ed. He afterwards showed me a wisp of hay, and a fetlock\nfull of oats; but I shook my head, to signify that neither of these were food\nfor me. And indeed I now apprehended that I must absolutely starve, if I did\nnot get to some of my own species; for as to those filthy Y ahoos , although\nthere were few greater lovers of mankind at that time than myself, yet I\nconfess I never saw any sensitive being so detestable on all accounts; and\nthe more I came near ",

This the master horse observed by my behaviour , and therefore\nsent the Y ahoo  back to his kennel. He then put his fore-hoof to his mouth, at\nwhich I was much surprised, although he did it with ease, and with a motion\nthat appeared perfectly natural, and made other signs, to know what I would\neat; but I could not return him such an answer as he was able to apprehend;\nand if he had understood me, I did not see how it was possible  to contrive\nany way for finding myself nourishment. While we were thus engaged, I\nobserved a cow passing by, whereupon I pointed to her, and expressed a\ndesire to go and milk her.

She gave me a large bowlful, of which I drank very heartily , and\nfound myself well refreshed.About noon, I saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn\nlike a sledge by four Y ahoos . There was in it an old steed, who seemed to be\nof quality; he alighted with his hind-feet forward, having by accident got a\nhurt in his left fore-foot. He came to dine with our horse, who received him\nwith great civilit y. They dined in the best room, and had oats boiled in milk\nfor the second course, which the old horse ate warm, but the rest cold.

In the middle was a large rack, with angles answering to every\npartition of the manger; so that each horse and mare ate their own hay, and\ntheir own mash  of oats and milk, with much decency and regularity . The\nbehaviour of the young colt and foal appeared very modest, and that of the\nmaster and mistress extremely cheerful and complaisant to their guest. The\ngray ordered me to stand by him; and much discourse passed between him\nand his friend concerning me, as I found by the stranger ’s often  looking on\nme, and the frequent repetition of the word Y ahoo .\nI happened to wear my gloves, which the master gray observing, seemed\nperplexed, disco vering signs of wonder what I had done to my forefeet.

He\nput his hoof three or four times to them, as if he would signify , that I should\nreduce them to their former shape, which I presently did, pulling off both\nmy gloves, and putting them into my pocket. This occasioned farther talk;\nand I saw the company was pleased with my behaviour , whereof I soon\nfound the good effects. I was ordered to speak the few words I understood;\nand while they were at dinner , the master taught me the names for oats,\nmilk, fire, water , and some others, which I could readily pronounce after\nhim, having from my youth a great facility in learning languages.\nWhen dinner was done, the master horse took me aside, and by signs and\nwords made me understand the concern he was in that I had nothing to eat.\nOats in their tongue are called hlunnh .

This word I pronounced two or three\ntimes; for although I had refuse d them at first, yet, upon second thoughts, I\nconsidered that I could contrive  to make of them a kind of bread, which\nmight be sufficient, with milk, to keep me alive, till I could make my escape\nto some other country , and to creatures of my own species. The horse\nimmediately ordered a white mare servant of his family to bring me a good\nquantity of oats in a sort of wooden tray. These I heated before  the fire, as\nwell as I could, and rubbed them till the husks came off, which I made a\nshift to winnow from the grain. I ground and beat them between  two stones;then took water , and made them  into a paste or cake, which I toasted at the\nfire and eat warm with milk.

However , it was necessary to mention this\nmatter , lest the world should think it impossible that I could find sustenance\nfor three years in such a country , and among such inhabitants.\nWhen it grew towards evening,  the master horse ordered a place for me\nto lodge in; it was but six yards from the house and separate d from the\nstable of the Y ahoos .

He gives his master a short account of his\nvoyage.\nMy principal endeavour was to learn the language, which my master (for\nso I shall hence forth call him), and his children, and every servant of his\nhouse, were desirous to teach me; for they looked upon it as a prodigy , that\na brute animal should discover such marks of a rational creature.

I pointed\nto every  thing, and inquired the name of it, which I wrote down in my\njournal-book when I was alone, and corrected my bad accent by desiring\nthose of the family to pronounc e it often. In this employment, a sorrel nag,\none of the under -servants, was very ready to assist me.\nIn speak ing, they pronounced through the nose and throat, and their\nlanguage approa ches nearest to the High-Dutch, or German, of any I know\nin Europe; but is much more graceful and significant. The empe ror Charles\nV. made  almost the same observation, when he said “that if he were to\nspeak to his horse, it should be in High-Dutch.”\nThe curiosity and impatience of my master were so great, that he spent\nmany hours of his leisure to instruct me.

He was most perplexed about my clothes, reasoning\nsometimes with himself, whethe r they were a part of my body: for I never\npulled them off till the family were asleep, and got them on before they\nwaked in the morning. My mast er was eager to learn “whence I came; how\nI acquir ed those appearances of reason, which I discovered in all my\nactions; and to know my story  from my own mouth, which he hoped he\nshould soon do by the great proficiency I made in learning and pronouncing\ntheir words and sentences.” To help my memory , I formed all I learned intothe English alphabet, and writ the words down, with the translations.

    "This\nlast, after some time, I ventured to do in my master ’s presence. It cost me\nmuch trouble to explain to him what I was doing; for the inhabitants have\nnot the least idea of books or literature.\nIn about ten weeks time, I was able to understand most of his questions;\nand in three months, could give him some tolerable answers. He was\nextremely curious to know “from what part of the country I came, and how\nI was taught to imitate a ration al creature; because the Yahoos  (whom  he\nsaw I exactly resembled in my head, hands, and face, that were only\nvisible), with some appearance of cunning, and the strongest disposition to\nmischief, were observed to be the most unteachable of all brutes.” I\nanswered, “that I came over the sea, from a far place, with many others of\nmy own kind, in a great hollow  vessel made of the bodies of trees: that my\ncompanions forced me to land on this coast, and then left me to shift for\nmyself.” It was with some difficulty , and by the help of many signs, that",

He replied, “that I must needs be mistaken,\nor that I said the thing which was not;” for they have no word in their\nlanguage to express lying or falsehood. “He knew it was impossible that\nthere could be a country beyon d the sea, or that a parcel of brutes could\nmove a wooden  vessel whither they pleased upon water . He was sure no\nHouyhnhnm  alive could make such a vessel, nor would trust Yahoos  to\nmanage it.”\nThe word Houyhnhnm , in their tongu e, signifies a horse , and, in its\netymology , the perfection of natur e. I told my mast er, “that I was at a loss\nfor expression, but would improve as fast as I could; and hope d, in a short\ntime, I should be able to tell him wonders.” He was pleased to direct his\nown mare, his colt, and foal, and the servants of",
    "for expression, but would improve as fast as I could; and hope d, in a short\ntime, I should be able to tell him wonders.” He was pleased to direct his\nown mare, his colt, and foal, and the servants of the family , to take all\nopportunities of instructing me; and every day, for two or three hours, he\nwas at the same  pains himself. Several horses and mares of quality in the\nneighbourhood came often to our house, upon the report spread of “a\nwonderful Yahoo , that could speak like a Houyhnhnm , and seemed, in his\nwords and actions, to discov er some glimmerings of reason.” These\ndelighted to converse with me: they put many questions, and received such\nanswers as I was able to return.  By all these advantages I made so great a\nprogress, that, in five months from my arrival I understood whatever was\nspoken, and could express myself tolerably well.The Houyhnhnms , who came to visit my master out of a design of seeing\nand talking with me, could hardly believe me to be a right Yahoo , because",

It\nhappened, one morning early , that my master sent for me by the sorrel nag,\nwho was his valet. When he came I was fast asleep, my clothes fallen off on\none side, and my shirt above my waist.

I awaked at the noise he made, and\nobserved him to deliver his message in some disorder; after which he went\nto my master , and in a great fright gave him a very confused  account of\nwhat he had seen. This I presen tly discovered, for, going as soon as I was\ndressed to pay my attendance upon his honour , he asked me “the meaning\nof what his servant had reported , that I was not the same thing when I slept,\nas I appeared to be at other times; that his valet assured him, some part of\nme was white, some yellow , at least not so white, and some brown.”\nI had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress, in order to distinguish\nmyself, as much as possible, from that cursed race of Yahoos ; but now I\nfound it in vain to do so any longer. Besides, I considered that my clothes\nand shoes would soon wear out, which already were in a declining\ncondition, and must be supplie d by some contrivance from the hides of\nYahoos , or other brute s; whereby the whole secret would be know n.

I\ntherefore told my master , “that in the country whence I came, those of my\nkind always covered their bodies with the hairs of certain animals prepared\nby art, as well for decency as to avoid the inclemencies of air, both hot and\ncold; of which, as to my own person, I would give him immediate\nconviction, if he pleased to command me: only desiring his excuse, if I did\nnot expose those parts that nature taught us to conceal.” He said, “my\ndiscourse was all very strange, but especially the last part; for he could not\nunderstand, why nature should teach us to conceal what nature had given;\nthat neither himself nor family were ashamed of any parts of their bodies;\nbut, however, I might do as I pleased.” Whereupon I first unbuttoned my\ncoat, and pulled it off.

I drew off my\nshoes, stockings , and breeches. I let my shirt down to my waist, and drewup the bottom; fastening it like a girdle about my middle, to hide my\nnakedness.\nMy master observed the whole performance with great signs of curiosity\nand admiration. He took up all my clothes in his pastern, one piece after\nanother , and examined them diligently; he then stroked my body very\ngently , and looked round me several times; after which, he said, it was plain\nI must be a perfect Yahoo ; but that I differed very much from the rest of my\nspecies in the softness, whiteness, and smoothness of my skin; my want of\nhair in several parts of my body; the shape and shortness of my claws\nbehind and before; and my affectation of walking continually on my two\nhinder feet.

He desired to see no more; and gave me leave to put on my\nclothes again, for I was shuddering with cold.\nI expressed my uneasiness at his giving me so often the appellation of\nYahoo , an odious anim al, for which I had so utter a hatred and contem pt: I\nbegged he would forbear apply ing that word to me, and make the same\norder in his family and among his friends whom he suffered to see me. I\nrequested likewise, “that the secret of my having a false covering to my\nbody , might be known to none but himself, at least as long as my present\nclothing should last; for as to what the sorrel nag, his valet, had observed,\nhis honour might command him to conceal it.”\nAll this my master very graciously consented to; and thus the secret was\nkept till my clothes began to wear out, which I was forced to supply by\nseveral contriva nces that shall here",

In the meantime, he\ndesired “I would go on with my utmost diligence to learn their language,\nbecause he was more astonished at my capacity for speech and reason, than\nat the figure of my body , whether it were covered or not;” adding, “that he\nwaited with some impatience to hear the wonders which I promised to tell\nhim.”\nFrom thenceforward he doubled the pains he had been at to instruct me:\nhe brought me into all company , and made them treat me with civility;\n“because,” as he told them, privately , “this would put me into good humour ,\nand make me more diverting.”\nEvery day, when I waited on him, beside the trouble he was at in\nteaching, he would ask me several questions concerning myself, which I\nanswered as well as I could, and by these means he had already received\n",
    "y, when I waited on him, beside the trouble he was at in\nteaching, he would ask me several questions concerning myself, which I\nanswered as well as I could, and by these means he had already received\nsome general ideas, though very imperfect. It would be tedious to relate theseveral steps by which I advanced to a more regular conversation; but the\nfirst account I gave of myself in any order and length was to this purpose:\n“That I came from a very far country , as I already had attempt ed to tell\nhim, with about fifty more of my own species; that we travell ed upon the\nseas in a great hollow vessel made of wood, and larger than his honour ’s\nhouse.

I said farther , “that if good fortune ever restored me to my\nnative country , to relate my travels hither , as I resolved to do, everybody\nwould believe, that I said the thing that was not, that I invented the story out\nof my own head; and (with all possible respect to himself, his family , and\nfriends, and under his promise of not being offended) our countrymen\nwould hardly think it probable that a Houyhnhnm  should be the presiding\ncreature of a nation, and a Yahoo  the brute.”CHAPTER IV.\nThe Houyhnhnms’  notion of truth and falsehood.

    "ehood. The\nauthor ’s discourse disapproved by his master . The author\ngives a more particular account of himself, and the accidents\nof his voyage.\nMy master heard me with great appearances of uneasiness in his\ncountenance; because doubting , or not believin g, are so little known in this\ncountry , that the inhabitants cannot tell how to behave thems elves under\nsuch circumstances. And I remember , in frequent discourses with my master\nconcerning the nature of manhood in other parts of the world, having\noccasion to talk of lying  and false representation , it was with much\ndifficulty that he comprehended what I meant, although he had otherwise a\nmost acute judgment. For he argued thus: “that the use of speech was to\nmake us understand one another , and to receive information of facts; now, if\nany one said the thing which was not, these ends were defeated, because I\ncannot properly be said to understand him; and I am so far from receiving\ninformation, that he leaves me worse than in igno",
    "if\nany one said the thing which was not, these ends were defeated, because I\ncannot properly be said to understand him; and I am so far from receiving\ninformation, that he leaves me worse than in ignorance; for I am led to\nbelieve a thing black, when it is white, and short, when it is long.” And\nthese were all the notions he had concerning that faculty of lying , so\nperfectly well understood, and so universally practised, among human\ncreatures.\nTo return from this digression. When I asserted that the Yahoos  were the\nonly governing animals in my country , which my master said was\naltogether past his conception , he desired to know , “whether we had\nHouyhnhnms  among us, and what was their employment?” I told him, “we\nhad great numbe rs; that in summer they grazed in the fields, and in winter\nwere kept in houses with hay and oats, where Yahoo  servants were\nemployed to rub their skins smooth, comb their manes, pick their feet, serve\nthem with food,  and make their beds.” “I understand y",
    "er\nwere kept in houses with hay and oats, where Yahoo  servants were\nemployed to rub their skins smooth, comb their manes, pick their feet, serve\nthem with food,  and make their beds.” “I understand you well,” said my\nmaster: “it is now very plain, from all you have spoken, that whatever share\nof reason the Yahoos  pretend to, the Houyhnhnms  are your mast ers; Iheartily wish our Yahoos  would be so tractable.” I begged “his honour\nwould please to excuse me from proceeding any further , because I was very\ncertain that the account he expected from me would be highly displeasing.”\nBut he insisted in commanding me to let him know the best and the worst. I\ntold him “he should be obeyed.” I owned “that the Houyhnhnms  among us,\nwhom we called horses, were the most generous and comely animals we\nhad; that they excelled in strength and swiftness; and when they belonged to\npersons of quality , were employ ed in travelling, racing, or drawi ng chariots;\nthey were treated with much kindness and ",

But the comm on race of horses had not so good fortune,\nbeing kept by farmers and carriers, and other mean people, who put them to\ngreater labour , and fed them worse.” I described, as well as I could, our way\nof riding; the shape and use of a bridle, a saddle, a spur, and a whip; of\nharness and wheels. I added, “that we fastened plates of a certain hard\nsubstance, calle d iron, at the bottom of their feet, to preserve their hoofs\nfrom being broken by the stony ways, on which we often travelled.”\nMy master, aft",
    "hat we fastened plates of a certain hard\nsubstance, calle d iron, at the bottom of their feet, to preserve their hoofs\nfrom being broken by the stony ways, on which we often travelled.”\nMy master, after some expressions of great indignation, wondered “how\nwe dared to venture upon a Houyhnhnm’ s back; for he was sure, that the\nweakest servant in his house would be able to shake off the strongest Yahoo ;\nor by lying down and rolling on his back, squeeze the brute to death.” I\nanswered “that our horses were  trained up, from three or four years old, to\nthe several uses we intended them for; that if any of them proved\nintolerably vicious, they were employed for carriages; that they were\nseverely beaten,  while they were  young, for any mischievous tricks; that the\nmales, designed  for the common use of riding or draught, were generally\ncastrated about two years after their birth, to take down their spirits, and\nmake them more  tame and gentl e; that they were indeed sensible  of rewards\nan",
    "on use of riding or draught, were generally\ncastrated about two years after their birth, to take down their spirits, and\nmake them more  tame and gentl e; that they were indeed sensible  of rewards\nand punishments; but his honour would please to consider , that they had not\nthe least tincture of reason, any more than the Yahoos  in this country .”\nIt put me to the pains of many circumlocutions, to give my master a right\nidea of what I spoke; for their language does not abound in variety of\nwords, because their wants and passions are fewer than among us. But it is\nimpossible to express his noble  resentment at our savage treatment of the\nHouyhnhnm  race; particularly after I had explained the manner and use ofcastrating horses  among us, to hinder them from propagating their kind, and\nto render them more servile. He said, “if it were possible there could be any\ncountry where Yahoos  alone were endued with reason, they certainly must\nbe the governing  animal; because reason in time will ",
    "nder them more servile. He said, “if it were possible there could be any\ncountry where Yahoos  alone were endued with reason, they certainly must\nbe the governing  animal; because reason in time will always prevail against\nbrutal strength. But, considering the frame of our bodies, and especially of\nmine, he thought no creature of equal bulk was so ill-contrived for\nemploying that reason in the common offices of life;” whereupon he desired\nto know “whether those among whom I lived resembled me, or the Yahoos\nof his country?” I assured him, “that I was as well shaped as most of my\nage; but the younger , and the females, were much more soft and tender , and\nthe skins of the latter generally as white as milk.” He said, “I differed\nindeed from other Yahoos , being much more cleanly , and not altogether so\ndeformed; but, in point of real advantage, he thought I differed for the\nworse: that my nails were of no use either to my fore or hinder feet; as to\nmy forefeet, he could not properly call",
    "together so\ndeformed; but, in point of real advantage, he thought I differed for the\nworse: that my nails were of no use either to my fore or hinder feet; as to\nmy forefeet, he could not properly call them by that name, for he never\nobserved me to walk upon them ; that they were too soft to bear the ground;\nthat I generally  went with them uncovered; neither was the covering I\nsometimes wore  on them of the same shape, or so strong as that on my feet\nbehind: that I could not walk with any security , for if either of my hinder\nfeet slipped, I must inevitably fall.” He then began to find fault with other\nparts of my body: “the flatness of my face, the prominence of my nose, my\neyes placed directly in front, so that I could not look on either side without\nturning my head: that I was not able to feed myself, without lifting one of\nmy forefeet to my mouth: and therefore nature had placed those joints to\nanswer that necessity .

    "to feed myself, without lifting one of\nmy forefeet to my mouth: and therefore nature had placed those joints to\nanswer that necessity . He knew not what could be the use of those several\nclefts and divisions in my feet behind; that these were too soft to bear the\nhardness and sharpness of stones, without a covering made from the skin of\nsome other brute; that my whole  body wanted a fence against heat and cold,\nwhich I was forced to put on and off every day, with tedio usness and\ntrouble: and lastly , that he observed every animal in this country naturally to\nabhor the Yahoos , whom the weaker avoided, and the stronger drove from\nthem. So that, supposing us to have the gift of reason, he could not see how\nit were possibl e to cure that natural antipathy , which every creature\ndiscovered against us; nor consequently how we could tame and render\nthem serviceable.

However , he would,” as he said, “debate the matter no\nfarther , because he was more desirous to know my own story , the countrywhere I was born, and the several actions and events of my life, before I\ncame hither .”\nI assured him, “how extremely desirous I was that he should be satisfied\non every point; but I doubted much, whether it would be possible for me to\nexplain myself on several subjects, whereof his honour could have no\nconception; because I saw nothing in his country to which I could resemble\nthem; that, however , I would do my best, and strive to expres s myself by\nsimilitudes, humbly desiring his assistance when I wanted proper words;”\nwhich he was pleased to promise me.\nI said, “my birth was of hone st parents, in an island called England;\nwhich was remote from his country , as many days’  journey as the strongest\nof his honour ’s servants could travel in the annual course of the sun; that I\nwas bre",

Some were undone by lawsuits; others spent all they had in\ndrinking, whoring, and gaming;  others fled for treason; many for murder ,\ntheft, poisoning, robbery , perjury , forgery, coining false money , for\ncommitting rapes, or sodomy; for flying from their colours, or deserting to\nthe enem y; and most of them had broken prison; none of these durst return\nto their native countries, for fear of being hanged, or of starving in a jail;\nand therefore they were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in other\nplaces.”\nDuring this discourse, my master was pleased to interrupt me several\ntimes.

I had made use of many  circumlocutions in describing  to him the\nnature of the several crimes for which most of our crew had been forced to\nfly their country . This labour took up several days’  conversation, before hewas able to comprehend me. He was wholly at a loss to know what could be\nthe use or necessity of practising those vices. To clear up which, I\nendeavoured to give some ideas of the desire of power and riches; of the\nterrible effects of lust, intemperance, malice, and envy . All this I was forced\nto define and describe by putting cases and making suppositions. After\nwhich, like one whose imaginati on was struck with something never seen or\nheard of before,  he would lift up his eyes with amazement and indignation.\nPower , governm ent, war, law, punishment, and a thousand other things, had\nno terms wherein that language could express them, which made the\ndiffic",

But being of an excellent understanding, much improved by\ncontemplation and converse, he at last arrived at a competent knowledge of\nwhat human nature, in our parts of the world, is capable to perform, and\ndesired I would give him some particular account of that land which we call\nEurope, but especially of my own country .CHAPTER V.\nThe author at his master ’s command, informs him of the\nstate of England .

I laid before him, as well as I could, the whole state of\nEurope; I discoursed of trade and manufactures, of arts and sciences; and\nthe answers I gave to all the questions he made, as they arose upon several\nsubjects, were a fund of conver sation not to be exhausted. But I shall here\nonly set down the substance of what passed between us concerning my own\ncountry , reducing it in order as well as I can, without any regard to time or\nother circumstan ces, while I strictly adhere to truth. My only concern is,\nthat I shall hardly be able to do justice to my master ’s arguments and\nexpressions, which must needs suffer by my want of capacity , as well as by\na translation into our barbarous English.\n",
    "ncern is,\nthat I shall hardly be able to do justice to my master ’s arguments and\nexpressions, which must needs suffer by my want of capacity , as well as by\na translation into our barbarous English.\nIn obedience, therefore, to his honour ’s commands, I related to him the\nRevolution unde r the Prince of Orange; the long war with France, entered\ninto by the said prince, and renewed by his successor , the present queen,\nwherein the greatest powers of Christendom were engaged, and which still\ncontinued: I computed, at his request, “that about a million of Y ahoos  might\nhave been killed  in the whole progress of it; and perhaps a hundred or more\ncities taken, and five times as many ships burnt or sunk.”\nHe asked me, “what were the usual causes or motives that made one\ncountry go to war with another?” I answered “they were innumerable; but I\nshould only mention a few of the chief. Sometimes the ambition  of princes,\nwho never think  they have land or people enough to govern; sometimes the\n",
    "nother?” I answered “they were innumerable; but I\nshould only mention a few of the chief. Sometimes the ambition  of princes,\nwho never think  they have land or people enough to govern; sometimes the\ncorruption of ministers, who engage their master in a war, in order to stifleor divert the clamour of the subjects against their evil administration.\nDifference in opinions has cost many millions of lives: for instance,\nwhether flesh be bread, or bread be flesh; whether the juice of a certain\nberry be blood or wine; whether whistling be a vice or a virtue; whether it\nbe better to kiss a post, or throw  it into the fire; what is the best colour for a\ncoat, whether black, white, red, or gray; and whether it should be long or\nshort, narrow or wide, dirty or clean; with many more.

    "wars\nso furious and bloody , or of so long a continuance, as those occasioned by\ndifference in opinion, especially if it be in things indif ferent.\n“Sometimes the quarrel between two princes is to decide which  of them\nshall dispossess a third of his dominions, where neither of them  pretend to\nany right. Sometimes one prince quarrels with another for fear the other\nshould quarrel with him. Sometimes a war is entered upon, because the\nenemy is too strong; and sometimes, because he is too weak.  Sometimes\nour neighbours want the things which we have, or have the things which we\nwant, and we both fight, till they take ours, or give us theirs. It is a very\njustifiable cause of a war, to invade a country after the people  have been\nwasted by famine, destroyed by pestilence, or embroiled by factions among\nthemselves. It is justifiable to enter into war against our nearest ally, when\none of his towns lies convenien t for us, or a territory of land,  that would\nrender our dominions round and ",
    "tions among\nthemselves. It is justifiable to enter into war against our nearest ally, when\none of his towns lies convenien t for us, or a territory of land,  that would\nrender our dominions round and complete. If a prince sends forces into a\nnation, where the people are poor and ignorant, he may lawfully put half of\nthem to death, and make slaves  of the rest, in order to civilize  and reduce\nthem from their barbarous way of living. It is a very kingly , honourable, and\nfrequent practice, when one prince desires the assistance of another , to\nsecure him against an invasion, that the assistant, when he has driven out\nthe invader , should seize on the dominions himself, and kill, imprison, or\nbanish, the prince he came to relieve. Alliance by blood, or marriage, is a\nfrequent cause of war between princes; and the nearer the kindred is, the\ngreater their disposition to quarrel; poor nations are hungry , and rich nations\nare proud; and pride and hunger will ever be at variance. For these r",
    "tween princes; and the nearer the kindred is, the\ngreater their disposition to quarrel; poor nations are hungry , and rich nations\nare proud; and pride and hunger will ever be at variance. For these reasons,\nthe trade of a soldier is held the most honourable of all others; because a\nsoldier is a Y ahoo  hired to kill, in cold blood, as many of his own species,\nwho have never of fended him, as possibly he can.\n“There is likewise a kind of beggarly princes in Europe, not able to make\nwar by themselv es, who hire out their troops to richer nations, for so much\na day to each man; of which they keep three-fourths to themselves, and it isthe best part of their maintenanc e: such are those in many northern parts of\nEurope.”\n“What you have told me,” said my master , “upon the subject of war, does\nindeed discover most admirably  the effects of that reason you pretend to:\nhowever , it is happy that the shame is greater than the danger; and that\nnature has left you utterly incapable of doing much",
    "indeed discover most admirably  the effects of that reason you pretend to:\nhowever , it is happy that the shame is greater than the danger; and that\nnature has left you utterly incapable of doing much mischief. For, your\nmouths lying flat with your faces, you can hardly bite each other to any\npurpose, unless by consent. Then as to the claws upon your feet before and\nbehind, they are so short and tender , that one of our Y ahoos  would drive a\ndozen of yours before him. And therefore, in recounting the numbers of\nthose who have  been killed in battle, I cannot but think you have said the\nthing which is not.”\nI could not forbear shaking my head, and smiling a little at his ignorance.\nAnd being no stranger to the art of war , I gave him a description of cannons,\nculverins, musk ets, carabines, pistols, bullets, powder , sword s, bayonets,\nbattles, sieges, retreats, attacks, undermines, countermines, bombardments,\nsea fights, ships sunk with a thousand men, twenty thousand killed on each\ns",
    ", pistols, bullets, powder , sword s, bayonets,\nbattles, sieges, retreats, attacks, undermines, countermines, bombardments,\nsea fights, ships sunk with a thousand men, twenty thousand killed on each\nside, dying groans, limbs flying in the air, smoke, noise,  confusion,\ntrampling to death under horses’  feet, flight, pursuit, victory; fields strewed\nwith carcases, left for food to dogs and wolves and birds of prey;\nplundering, stripping, ravishing , burning, and destroying. And to set forth\nthe valour of my own dear countrymen, I assured him, “that I had seen them\nblow up a hundred enemies at once in a siege, and as many in a ship, and\nbeheld the dead bodies drop down in pieces from the clouds, to the great\ndiversion of the spectators.”\nI was going on to more particulars, when my master commanded me\nsilence. He said, “whoever understood the nature of Y ahoos , might easily\nbelieve it possible for so vile an animal to be capable of every action I had\nnamed, if their strength and cunning ",
    "manded me\nsilence. He said, “whoever understood the nature of Y ahoos , might easily\nbelieve it possible for so vile an animal to be capable of every action I had\nnamed, if their strength and cunning equalled their malice. But as my\ndiscourse had increased his abhorrence of the whole species, so he found it\ngave him a disturbance in his mind to which he was wholly  a stranger\nbefore. He thought his ears, being used to such abominable words, might,\nby degrees, admit them with less detestation: that although he hated the\nY ahoos  of this countr y, yet he no more blamed them for their odious\nqualities, than he did a gnnayh  (a bird of prey) for its cruelty , or a sharp\nstone for cutting  his hoof. But when a creature pretending to reason couldbe capable of such enormities, he dreaded lest the corruption of that faculty\nmight be worse than brutality itself. He seemed therefore confident, that,\ninstead of reason  we were only possessed of some quality fitted  to increase\nour natural vices ;",

There was another point, which a little\nperplexed him at present. I had informed him, that some of our crew left\ntheir country on account of being ruined by law; that I had already\nexplained the meaning of the word; but he was at a loss how it should come\nto pass, that the law, which was intended for every man’ s preservation,\nshould be any man’ s ruin.

To this society all the rest of\nthe peop le are slaves. For examp le, if my neighbour has a mind to my cow,\nhe has a lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cow from me.

    "if my neighbour has a mind to my cow,\nhe has a lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cow from me. I must then\nhire another to defend my right, it being against all rules of law that any\nman should be allowed to speak for himself. Now , in this case, I, who am\nthe right  owner , lie under two great disadvantages: first, my lawyer , being\npractised almost  from his cradle  in defending falsehood, is quite out of his\nelement when he would be an advocate for justice, which is an unnatural\noffice he always attempts with great awkwardness, if not with ill-will. The\nsecond disadvan tage is, that my lawyer must proceed with great caution, or\nelse he will be reprimanded by the judges, and abhorred by his brethren, as\none that would lessen the practice of the law. And therefore I have but two\nmethods to preserve my cow.

The second way is for my lawyer to make my\ncause appear as unjust as he can, by allowing the cow to belong to my\nadversary: and this, if it be skilfully done, will certainly bespeak the favour\nof the bench. Now your honou r is to know , that these judges are persons\nappointed to decide all controve rsies of property , as well as for the trial of\ncriminals, and picked out from the most dexterous lawyers, who are grown\nold or lazy; and having been biassed all their lives against truth and equity ,\nlie unde r such a fatal necessity of favouring fraud, perjury , and oppression,\nthat I have know n some of them  refuse a large bribe from the side where\njustice lay, rather than injure the faculty , by doing any thing unbecoming\ntheir nature or their of fice.\n“It is a maxim among these lawyers that whatever has been done b",

These, under the name of precedents, they produce as\nauthorities to justify the most iniquitous opinions; and the judges never fail\nof directing accordingly .\n“In pleading, they studiously avoid entering into the merits of the cause;\nbut are loud, violent, and tedious, in dwelling upon all circumsta nces which\nare not to the purpose. For instance, in the case already mentioned; they\nnever desire to know what claim  or title my adversary has to my cow; but\nwhether the said cow were red or black; her horns long or short; whether\nthe field I graze her in be round or square; whether she was milked at home\nor abroad; what dis",

Whereupon I was at much pains to describe to him the use of\nmoney , the materials it was made of, and the value of the metals; “that\nwhen a Y ahoo  had got a great store of this precious substance, he was able\nto purchase whatever he had a mind to; the finest clothing, the noblest\nhouses, great tracts of land, the most costly meats and drinks, and have his\nchoice of the most beautiful fem",

Therefore he desired I would let\nhim know, “wha t these costly meats were, and how any of us happened to\nwant them?” Whereupon I enumerated as many sorts as came into my head,\nwith the various methods of dressing them, which could not be done\nwithout sending  vessels by sea to every part of the world, as well for liquors\nto drink  as for sauces and innumerable other conveniences. I assured him\n“that this whole globe of earth must be at least three times gone round\nbefore one of our better female Y ahoos  could get her breakfast, or a cup toput it in.” He said “that must needs be a miserable country which cannot\nfurnish food for its own inhabitants.

But, in order to feed the\nluxury and intemperance of the males, and the vanity of the females, we\nsent away the greatest part of our necessary things to other countries,\nwhence, in return, we brought the materials of diseases, folly, and vice, to\nspend among ourselves.

To remedy which, there\nwas a sort of people bred up among us in the profession, or pretence, of\ncuring the sick. And because I had some skill in the faculty , I would, in\ngratitude to his honour , let him know the whole mystery and method by\nwhich they proceed.\n“Their fundamental is, that all diseases arise from repletion; whence they\nconclude, that a great evacuation of the body is necessary , either through the\nnatural passage or upwards at the mouth.

But I must freely\nconfess, that the many virtues of those excellent quadrupeds, placed in\nopposite view to human corruptions, had so far opened my eyes and\nenlar ged my understanding, that I began to view the actions and passions of\nman in a very different light, and to think the honour of my own kind not\nworth managing; which, beside s, it was impossible for me to do, before a\nperson of so acute a judgment as my master , who daily convin ced me of a\nthousand faults in myself, where of I had not the least perception before, and\nwhich, with us, would never be numbered even among human infirmities.

This I have since often known\nto have been taken with success, and do here freely recommend it to my\ncountrymen for the public good, as an admirable specific against all\ndiseases produced by repletion.\n“As to learning, government, arts, manufactures, and the like,” my master\nconfessed, “he could find little or no resemblance between the Yahoos  of\nthat country and those in ours;  for he only meant to observe what parity\nthere was in our natures.

    " parity\nthere was in our natures. He had heard, indeed, some curious Houyhnhnms\nobserve, that in most herds there was a sort of ruling Yahoo  (as among us\nthere is generally some leading or principal stag in a park), who was always\nmore deformed in body , and mischievous in disposition, than any of the\nrest; that this leader had usually  a favourite as like himself as he could get,\nwhose employm ent was to lick his master ’s feet and posteriors, and drive\nthe female Yahoos  to his kennel; for which he was now and then rewarded\nwith a piece of ass’s flesh. This favourite is hated by the whole herd, and\ntherefore, to protect himself, keeps always near the person of his leader . He\nusually continues in office till a worse can be found; but the very moment\nhe is discarded, his successor , at the head of all the Yahoos  in that district,\nyoung and old, male and female, come in a body , and discharge their\nexcrements upon him from head to foot.

But how far this might be\napplicable to our courts, and favourites, and ministers of state, my master\nsaid I could best determine.”\nI durst make no return to this malicious insinuation, which debased\nhuman understanding below the sagacity of a common hound, who has\njudgment enough to distinguish  and follow the cry of the ables t dog in the\npack, without being ever mistaken.\nMy master told me, “there were some qualities remarkable in the Yahoos ,\nwhich he had not observed me to mention, or at least very slightly, in the\naccounts I had given of human kind.” He said, “those animals, like other\nbrutes, had their females in common; but in this they differed, that the she\nYahoo  would admit the males while she was pregnant; and that the hes\nwould quarrel and fight with the females, as fiercely as with each other;both which practices were su",

But I could have easily vindicated humankind\nfrom the imputa tion of singularity upon the last article, if there had been\nany swine in that country (as unluckily for me there were not), which,\nalthough it may be a sweeter quadruped than a Yahoo , cannot, I humbly\nconceive, in justice, pretend to more cleanliness; and s",

He\nsaid, “a fancy would sometimes take a Yahoo  to retire into a corner , to lie\ndown, and howl, and groan, and spurn away all that came near him,\nalthough he were young and fat, wanted neither food nor water , nor did the\nservant imagine what could possibly ail him. And the only remedy they\nfound was, to set him to hard work, after which he would infalli bly come to\nhimself.” To this I was silent out of partiality to my own kind; yet here I\ncould plainly discover the true seeds of spleen, which only seizes on the\nlazy, t",

    "  if a female stranger came among them, three or four of\nher own sex would get about her, and stare, and chatter , and grin, and smell\nher all over; and then turn off with gestures, that seemed to express\ncontempt and disdain.”Perhaps my master might refin e a little in these speculations, which he\nhad draw n from  what he observed himself, or had been told him by others;\nhowever , I could not reflect without some amazement, and much sorrow ,\nthat the rudimen ts of lewdness, coquetry , censure, and scandal, should have\nplace by instinct in womankind.\nI expected every moment that my master would accuse the Yahoos  of\nthose unnatural appetites in both sexes, so common among us. But nature, it\nseems, has not been so expert a school-mistress; and these politer pleasures\nare entirely the productions of art and reason on our side of the globe.CHAPTER VIII.\nThe author relates several particulars of the Y ahoos .

The education and\nexercise of their youth. Their general assembly .\nAs I ought to have understood human nature much better than I supposed\nit possible for my master to do, so it was easy to apply the character he gave\nof the Y ahoos  to myself and my countrymen; and I believed I could yet\nmake further discoveries, from my own observation. I therefore often\nbegged his honour to let me go among the herds of Y ahoos  in the\nneighbourhood; to which he always very graciously consented, being\nperfectly convin ced that the hatred I bore these brutes would never suffer\nme to be corrup ted by them; and his honour ordered one of his servants, a\nstrong sorrel nag, very honest and good-natured, to be my guard; without\nwhose protection I durst not undertake such adventures.

For I have already\ntold the reader how much I was pestered by these odious animals, upon my\nfirst arrival; and I afterwards failed very narrowly , three or four times, of\nfalling into their clutches, when I happened to stray at any distance without\nmy hang er. And I have reason to believe they had some imagin ation that I\nwas of their own species, which I often assisted myself by stripping up my\nsleeves, and showing my naked  arms and breast in their sight, when my\nprotector was with me. At which times they would approach as near as they\ndurst, and imita te my actions after the manner of monkeys, but ever with\ngreat signs of hatred; as a tame jackdaw with cap and stockings is always\npersecuted by the wild ones, when he happens to be got among them.\nThey are prodigiously nimble from their infancy .

I observed the young animal’ s flesh to smell very rank,and the stink was somewhat between a weasel and a fox, but much more\ndisagreeable. I forgot another circumstance (and perhaps I might have the\nreader ’s pardon  if it were wholly omitted), that while I held the odious\nvermin in my hands, it voided its filthy excrements of a yellow liquid\nsubstance all over my clothes; but by good fortune there was a small brook\nhard by, where I was",

Yet I am of opinion this defect arises chiefly from a perverse,\nrestive disposition; for they are cunning, malicious, treacherous, and\nrevengeful. They are strong and hardy , but of a cowardly spirit, and, by\nconsequence, insolent, abject, and cruel. It is observed, that the red haired\nof both sexes are more libidinous and mischievous than the rest, whom yet\nthey much exceed in strength and activity .\nThe Houyhnhnms  keep the Y ahoos  for present use in huts not far from the\nhouse; but the rest are sent abroa d to cer",

He\nconsented, and I immediately stripped myself stark naked, and went down\nsoftly into the stream. It happe ned that a young female Y ahoo , standing\nbehind a bank, saw the whole proceeding, and inflamed by desire, as the\nnag and I conjectured, came running with all speed, and leaped into the\nwater , within five yards of the place where I bathed. I was neve r in my life\nso terrib ly frightened. The nag was grazing at some distance, not suspecting\nany harm . She embraced me after a most fulsome manner . I roared as loud\nas I could, and the nag came galloping towards me, whereupon  she quittedher grasp, with the utmost reluc tancy , and leaped upon the opposite bank,\nwhere she stood gazing and howling all the time I was putting on my\nclothes.\nThis was a matter of diversion to my master and his family , as well ",

For now I could no longer deny that I was a real\nY ahoo  in every  limb and feature, since the females had a natural propensity\nto me, as one of their own specie s. Neither was the hair of this brute of a red\ncolour (which might have been some excuse for an appe tite a little\nirregular), but black as a sloe, and her countenance did not make an\nappearance altogether so hideous as the rest of her kind; for I think she\ncould not be above eleven years old.\nHaving lived three years in this country , the reader , I suppose, will expect\nthat I should, like other travellers, give him some account of the manners\nand customs of its inhabitants, which it was indeed my principal study to\nlearn.\nAs these noble Houyhnhnms  are endowed by nature with a general\ndisposition t",

Neither is reason among them a point problematical,\nas with us, where men can argue with plausibility on both sides of the\nquestion, but strikes you with immediate conviction; as it must needs do,\nwhere it is not mingled, obscure d, or discoloured, by passion and interest. I\nremember it was with extreme difficulty that I could bring my master to\nunderstand the meaning of the word opinion, or how a point could be\ndisputable; because reason taught us to affirm or deny only where we are\ncertain; and beyond our knowledge we cannot do either .

So that\ncontroversies, wranglings, disputes, and positiveness, in false or dubious\npropositions, are evils unknown among the Houyhnhnms . In the like\nmanner , when I used to explain to him our several systems of natural\nphilosophy , he would laugh, “that a creature pretending to reason, should\nvalue itself upon the knowledge of other people’ s conjectures, and in things\nwhere that knowledge, if it were certain, could be of no use.” Wherein he\nagreed entirely with the sentiments of Socrates, as Plato delivers them;\nwhich I mention  as the highest honour I can do that prince of philosophers.\nI have often since reflected, what destruction such doctrine would make inthe libraries of Europe; and how many paths of fame would be then shut up\nin the learned world.\nFriendship and benevolence are the two principal virtues among the\nHouyhnhnms ; and these not confined to particular obj",

They preserve decency and civility in the highest degrees, but are\naltogether ignor ant of ceremony . They have no fondness for their colts or\nfoals, but the care they take in educating them proceeds entire ly from the\ndictates of reason. And I observ ed my master to show the same affection to\nhis neighbour ’s issue, that he had for his own.

This caution is necessary , to\nprevent the country from being overburdened with numbers. But the race of\ninferior Houyhnhnms , bred up to be servants, is not so strictly limited upon\nthis article: these are allowed to produce three of each sex, to be domestics\nin the noble families.\nIn their marriages, they are exactly careful to choose such colours as will\nnot make any disagreeable mixture in the breed.

Strength is chiefly valued\nin the male, and comeliness in the female; not upon the account of love, but\nto preserve the race from degenerating; for where a female happens to excel\nin strength, a consort is chosen, with regard to comeliness.\nCourtship, love,  presents, jointures, settlements have no place in their\nthoughts, or terms whereby to express them in their language. The young\ncouple meet, and are joined, merely because it is the determination of their\nparents and friends; it is what they see done every day, and they look upon\nit as one of the necessary actions of a reasonable being. But the violation of\nmarriage, or any other unchastit y, was never heard of; and the married pair\npass their lives with the same friendship and mutual benevolence, that theybear to all others of the same  species who come in their way, without\njealousy , fondness, quarrelling, or discontent",

These are not suffered to taste a grain of oats,\nexcept upon certain days, till eighteen years old; nor milk, but very rarely;\nand in summer they graze two hours in the morning, and as many in the\nevening, which their parents likewise observe; but the servants are not\nallowed above half that time, and a great part of their grass is brought\nhome, which they eat at the most convenient hours, when they can be best\nspared from work.\nTemperance, industry , exercise, and cleanliness, are the lessons equally\nenjoined to the young ones of both sexes: and my master thought it\nmonstrous in us, to give the females a different kind of education from the\nmales, except in some articles of domestic mana",

Four times a year the youth\nof a certain district meet to show their proficiency in running and leaping,\nand other feats of strength and agility; where the victor is rewa rded with a\nsong in his or her praise.

The\ndefectiveness of their language.\nOne of these grand assemblies was held in my time, about three months\nbefore my departure, whither my master went as the represent ative of our\ndistrict. In this council was resumed their old debate, and indeed the only\ndebate that ever happened in their country; whereof my master , after his\nreturn, gave me a very particular account.\nThe question to be debated was, “whether the Yahoos  should  be\nexterminated from the face of the earth?",

    "hereof he had indeed\nborrowed the hint from me. “He approved of the tradition mentioned by the\nhonourable member who spoke before, and affirmed, that the two Yahoos\nsaid to be seen first among them, had been driven thither over the sea; that\ncoming to land, and being forsaken by their companions, they retired to the\nmountains, and degenerating by degrees, became in process of time much\nmore savage than those of their own species in the country whence these\ntwo originals came. The reason of this assertion was, that he had now in his\npossession a certain wonderful Yahoo  (meani ng myself) which most of\nthem had heard of, and many of them had seen. He then related to them\nhow he first found me; that my body was all covered with an artificial\ncomposure of the skins and hairs of other animals; that I spoke in a\nlanguage of my own, and had thoroughly learned theirs; that I had related to\nhim the acciden ts which brought me thither; that when he saw me without\nmy covering, I was an exact Yaho",

He added, how I had endeavoured to\npersuade him, that in my own and other countries, the Yahoos  acted as the\ngoverning, rational animal, and held the Houyhnhnms  in servi tude; that he\nobserved in me all the qualities of a Yahoo , only a little more civilized by\nsome tincture of reason, which,  however , was in a degree as far inferior to\nthe Houyhnhnm  race, as the Yahoos  of their countr y were to me; that,\namong other things, I mentioned a custom we had of castrating\nHouyhnhnms  when they were  young, in order to render them tame; that the\noperation was easy and safe; that it was no shame to learn wisdom from\nbrutes, as indust ry is taught by the ant, and building by the swall ow (for so I\ntranslate the wo",

With tools made of these flints, they likewise cut their hay, and\nreap their oats, which there grow naturally in several fields; the Yahoos\ndraw home the sheaves in carriages, and the servants tread them in certain\ncovered huts to get out the grain, which is kept in stores. They make a rude\nkind of earthen and wooden vessels, and bake the former in the sun.\nIf they can avoid casualties, they die only of old age, and are buried in\nthe obscurest places that can be found, their friends and relations expressing\nneither joy nor grief at their departure; nor does the dying person discover\nthe least regret that he is leaving  the world, any more than if he were upon\nreturning home from a visit to one of his neighbours.

I remember my master\nhaving once made an appointment with a friend and his family to come to\nhis house, upon some affair of importance: on the day fixed, the mistress\nand her two children came very late; she made two excuses, first for her\nhusband, who, as she said, happened that very morning to shnuwnh . The\nword is strongly expressive in their language, but not easily rendered into\nEnglish; it signifies, “to retire  to his first mother .” Her excuse for not\ncoming sooner , was, that her husband dying late in the morning, she was a\ngood while consulting her servants about a convenient place where his body\nshould be laid; and I observed, she behaved herself at our house as\ncheerfully as the rest.

He falls into a swoon  for grief; but submits. He\ncontrives and finishes a canoe by the help of a fellow-\nservant, and puts to sea at a venture.\nI had settled my little economy to my own heart’ s content. My master\nhad ordered a room to be made  for me, after their manner , about six yards\nfrom the house: the sides and floors of which I plastered with clay, and\ncovered with rush-mats of my own contriving.

I had beaten hemp, which\nthere grows wild, and made of it a sort of ticking; this I filled with the\nfeathers of several birds I had taken with springes made of Y ahoos’  hairs,\nand were excelle nt food. I had worked two chairs with my knife, the sorrel\nnag helping me in the grosser and more laborious part. When my clothes\nwere worn to rags, I made myself others with the skins of rabbits, and of a\ncertain beautiful animal, about the same size, called nnuhnoh , the skin of\nwhich is covered with a fine down. Of these I also made very tolerable\nstockings. I soled my shoes with wood, which I cut from a tree, and fitted to\nthe upper-leather; and when this was worn out, I supplied it with the skins\nof Y ahoos  dried in the sun. I often got honey out of hollow trees, which I\nmingled with water , or ate with my bread.

He went through all our vices and follies, and discovered many ,\nwhich I had never mentioned to him, by only supposing what qualities a\nY ahoo  of their country , with a small proportion of reason, might be capable\nof exerting; and concluded, with too much probability , “how vile, as well as\nmiserable, such a creature must be.”\nI freely confess , that all the little knowledge I have of any value, was\nacquired by the lectures I received from my master , and from hearing the\ndiscourses of him and his frien ds; to which I should be prouder to listen,\nthan to dictate to ",

When I happened to behold the reflection of my own\nform in a lake or fountain, I turned away my face in horror and detestation\nof myse lf, and could better endu re the sight of a common Y ahoo  than of my\nown person. By conversing with the Houyhnhnms , and looking upon them\nwith delight, I fell to imitate their gait and gesture, which is now grown into\na habit; and my friends often tell me, in a blunt way, “that I trot like a\nhorse;” which, however , I take for a great compliment.

I observed by his countenance that he was in some\nperplexity , and at a loss how to begin what he had to speak. After a short\nsilence, he told me, “he did not know how I would take what he was going\nto say: that in the last general assembly , when the affair of the Y ahoos  was\nentered upon, the representatives had taken offence at his keeping a Y ahoo\n(meaning myse lf) in his family , more like a Houyhnhnm  than a brute\nanimal; that he was known frequently to converse with me, as if he could\nreceive some advantage or pleasure in my company; that such a practice\nwas not agreeable to reason or nature, or a thing ever heard of before among\nthem; the ass",

When I came to myself, he told me “that he concluded I had been\ndead;” for these people are subject to no such imbecilities of nature.

I found some shellfish on the\nshore, and ate them raw, not daring to kindle a fire, for fear of being\ndiscovered by the natives.

Four of them, well armed, searched every\ncranny and lurking-hole, till at last they found me flat on my face behind\nthe stone.

I understoo d that language very well, and getting upon my feet, said,\n“I was a poor Yahoo  banishe d from the Houyhnhnms , and desired they\nwould please to let me depart.”  They admired to hear me answer them in\ntheir own tongue, and saw by my complexion I must be a European; but\nwere at a loss to know what I meant by Yahoos  and Houyhnhnms ; and at the\nsame time fell a-laughing at my strange tone in speaking, whic h resembled\nthe neighing of a horse. I tremb led all the while betwixt fear and hatred. I\nagain desired leave to depart, and was gently moving to my canoe; but they\nlaid hold of me, desiring to know , “what country I was of? when ce I came?”\nwith many other questions.

I\ntherefore hoped they would not treat me as an enemy , since I meant them no\nharm, but was a poor Yahoo  seeking  some desolate place where to pass the\nremainder of his unfortunate life.”When they bega n to talk, I thought I never heard or saw any thing more\nunnatural; for it appeared to me as monstrous as if a dog or a cow should\nspeak in England, or a Yahoo  in Houyhnhnmland . The honest Portuguese\nwere equally amazed at my stran ge dress, and the odd manner of delivering\nmy words, which, however , they understood very well. They spoke to me\nwith great humanity , and said, “they were sure the captain would carry me\ngratis  to Lisbon, whence I might return to my own country; that two of the\nseamen would go back to the ship, inform the captain of what they had\nseen, and receive his orders; in the mean time, unless I would give",

I thought it best to\ncomply with their proposal. They were very curious to know my story , but I\ngave them very little satisfaction, and they all conjectured that my\nmisfortunes had impaired my reason. In two hours the boat, which went\nladen with vessels of water , returned, with the captain’ s comm and to fetch\nme on board. I fell on my knees to preserve my liberty; but all was in vain;\nand the men, having tied me with cords, heaved me into the boat, whence I\nwas taken into the ship, and thence into the captain’ s cabin.\nHis name was Pedro de Mendez; he was a very courteous and generous\nperson.

He entreated me to give some account of myself, and desired to\nknow what I would eat or drink;  said, “I should be used as well as himself;”\nand spok e so many obliging things, that I wondered to find such civilities\nfrom a Yahoo . However , I remained silent and sullen; I was ready to faint at\nthe very smell of him and his men. At last I desired something to eat out of\nmy own canoe; but he ordered me a chicken, and some excellent wine, and\nthen directed that I should be put to bed in a very clean cabin. I would not\nundress myself, but lay on the bed-clothes, and in half an hour stole out,\nwhen I thought the crew was at dinner , and getting to the side of the ship,\nwas going to leap into the sea, and swim for my life, rather than continue\namong Yahoos .

I gave him a\nvery short relation of my voyage; of the conspiracy against me by my own\nmen; of the country where they set me on shore, and of my five years\nresidence there. All which he looked upon as if it were a dream  or a vision;whereat I took great offence; for I had quite forgot the faculty of lying, so\npeculiar to Yahoos , in all countries where they preside, and, consequently ,\ntheir disposition of suspecting truth in others of their own species.

In gratitude to the\ncaptain, I sometimes sat with him, at his earnest request, and strove to\nconceal my antipathy against humankind, although it often broke out; which\nhe suffered to pass without observation. But the greatest part of the day I\nconfined myself to my cabin, to avoid seeing any of the crew . The captain\nhad often entreated me to strip myself of my savage dress, and offered to\nlend me the best suit of clothes he had.

At our landing, the captain forced me\nto cover myself with his cloak, to prevent the rabble from crowding about\nme. I was conveyed to his own house; and at my earnest reques t he led me\nup to the highe st room backwards. I conjured him “to conceal from all\npersons what I had told him of the Houyhnhnms ; becaus e the least hint of\nsuch a story would not only draw numbers of people to see me, butprobably put me in danger of being imprisoned, or burnt by the\nInquisition.” The captain persu aded me to accept a suit of clothes newly\nmade; but I would not suffer the tailor to tak",

He accoutred\nme with other necessaries, all new, which I aired for twenty -four hours\nbefore I would use them.\nThe captain had no wife, nor above three servants, none of which were\nsuffered to attend at meals; and his whole deportment was so obliging,\nadded to very good human understanding, that I really began to tolerate his\ncompany . He gained so far upon  me, that I ventured to look out of the back\nwindow . By degrees I was brought into another room, whence I peeped into\nthe street, but drew my head back in a fright.

He said, “it was altogether\nimpossible to find such a solitary island as I desired to live in; but I might\ncommand in my own house, and pass my time in a manner as recluse as I\npleased.”\nI compli ed at last, finding I could not do better .

During this last voyage I had no commerce with the\nmaster or any of his men; but, pretending I was sick, kept close in my cabin.\nOn the fifth of December , 1715,  we cast anchor in the Downs, about nine in\nthe morning, and at three in the afternoon I got safe to my house at\nRotherhith.[546]\nMy wife and family received me with great surprise and joy, because\nthey concluded me certainly dead; but I must freely confess the sight ofthem filled me only with hatred, disgust, and contempt; and the more, by\nreflecting on the near alliance  I had to them.

    "s now since as a little boy in Baghdad I used to\nlisten to tales from \nThe Thousand and One Nights\n. It sometimes seems like\nyesterday, sometimes like ages ago, for the Baghdad I knew then seems now\ncloser to the time of the \nNights\n than to our own times. It was on long winter\nnights, when my grandmother was visited by one lady or another, Um Fatma\nor Um Ali, always dressed in black, still mourning for a husband or a son,\nlong lost. We would huddle around the brazier, as the embers glowed in the\ndim light of the oil lamp, which cast a soft shadow over her sad, wrinkled\nface, as if to smooth out the sorrows of the years. I waited patiently, while\nshe and my grandmother exchanged news, indulged in gossip, and whispered\none or two asides. Then there would be a pause, and the lady would smile at\nme, and I would seize the proffered opportunity and ask for a story—a long\nstory.

    " at\nme, and I would seize the proffered opportunity and ask for a story—a long\nstory. I used to like romances and fairy tales best, because they took me to a\nland of magic and because they were long.\nThe lady would begin the story, and I would listen, first apprehensively,\nknowing from experience that she would improvise, depending on how early\nor late the hour. If it was early enough, she would spin the yarn leisurely,\namplifying here and interpolating there episodes I recognized from other\nstories. And even though this sometimes troubled my childish notions of\nhonesty and my sense of security in reliving familiar events, I never objected,\nbecause it prolonged the action and the pleasure. If the hour was late, she\nwould, in spite of my entreaties, tell either a brief story or one of normal\nlength, summarizing here and omitting there. If I knew the story, I would\nprotest, reminding her of what she had left out, and she, smilingly, would\npromise to tell me the story in its entirety the ",
    "l\nlength, summarizing here and omitting there. If I knew the story, I would\nprotest, reminding her of what she had left out, and she, smilingly, would\npromise to tell me the story in its entirety the next time. I would then entreat\nher to narrate at least such and such an episode. Sometimes my grandmother,out of love for me and her own delight in the story, would add her voice to\nmine, and the lady, pleased to be appreciated and happy to oblige, would\nconsent to go on, narrating in a gentle, steady voice, except when she\nimpersonated a man or woman in a moment of passion or a demon in a fit of\nanger, at times getting up to act out the part. Her pauses were just as delicious\nas her words, as we waited, anticipating a pleasure certain to come. At last,\nwith the voice still steady but the pauses shorter and less frequent, she would\nreunite the lovers or reconcile the hero to fate, bringing the story, alas, to an\nend and leaving me with a feeling of nostalgia, a sense at once of fulfillmen",
    "ses shorter and less frequent, she would\nreunite the lovers or reconcile the hero to fate, bringing the story, alas, to an\nend and leaving me with a feeling of nostalgia, a sense at once of fulfillment\nand of loss.

Even angry demons are humanized and\npacified by a good story.

They are divided into nights, in sections of\nvarious lengths, a division that, although it follows no particular plan, serves\na dual purpose: it keeps Shahrayar and us in suspense and brings the action to\na more familiar level of reality. The essential quality of these tales lies intheir success in interweaving the unusual, the extraordinary, the marvelous,\nand the supernatural into the fabric of everyday life. Animals discourse and\ngive lessons in moral philosophy; normal men and women consort or struggle\nwith demons and, like them, change themselves or anyone else into any form\nthey please; and humble people lead a life full of accidents and surprises,\ndrinking with an exhalted caliph here or sleeping with a gorgeous girl there.\nYet both the usual incidents and the extraordinary coincidences are nothing\nbut the web and weft of Divine Providence, in a world in which people often\nsuffer but come out all",

As\nfor the readers, their pleasure is vicarious and aesthetic, derived from the\nescape into an exotic world of wish fulfillment and from the underlying act of\ntransformation and the consequent pleasure, which may be best defined in\nFreudian terms as the sudden overcoming of an obstacle.\nSuch an effect, which is contingent on merging the supernatural and the\nnatural and securing a willing suspension of disbelief, the storyteller of the\nNights\n produces by the precise and concrete detail that he uses in a matter-of-\nfact way in description, narration, and conversation, bridging the gap between\nthe natural and supernatural situations.

It is this quality, by the way, that\nexplains the appeal of these tales to the romantic imagination. For instance,\nthe she-demon is a serpent as thick as the trunk of a palm tree, while the\ndemon is as thin as a spear and as long as two; the transparent curtain hiding\nthe gorgeous girl in the bed is red-speckled; and the seductive girl from\nBaghdad buys ten pounds of mutton, while the pious gardener buys two\nflagons of wine for the mysterious lovers. Thus the phantasmagoric is based\non the concrete, the supernatural grounded in the natural.\nDissemination and Manuscripts\nTHE STORIES OF the \nNights\n are of various ethnic origins, Indian, Persian,\nand Arabic.

They were\nalso modified, as in my own experience, to suit the role of the storyteller or\nthe demand of the occasion. But different as their ethnic origins may be, these\nstories reveal a basic homogeneity resulting from the process ofdissemination and assimilation under Islamic hegemony, a homogeneity or\ndistinctive synthesis that marks the cultural and artistic history of Islam.\nNo one knows exactly when a given story originated, but it is evident\nthat some stories circulated orally for centuries before they began to be\ncollected and written down.

    "rab historians of the tenth century, like al-\nMas’udi and ibn al-Nadim speak of the existence of such collections in their\ntime. One was an Arabic work called \nThe Thousand Tales\n or \nThe Thousand\nNights\n, a translation from a Persian work entitled \nHazar Afsana\n (A thousand\nlegends). Both works are now lost, but although it is not certain whether any\nof these stories or which of them were retained in subsequent collections, it is\ncertain that the \nHazar Afsana\n supplied the popular title as well as the general\nscheme—the frame story of Shahrazad and Shahrayar and the division into\nnights—to at least one such collection, namely \nThe Thousand and One\nNights\n.\nThe stories of the \nNights\n circulated in different manuscript copies until\nthey were finally written down in a definite form, or what may be referred to\nas the original version, in the second half of the thirteenth century, within the\nMamluk domain, either in Syria or in Egypt.

That version, now lost, was\ncopied a generation or two later in what became the archetype for subsequent\ncopies. It too is now lost, but its existence is clearly attested to by the\nremarkable similarities in substance, form, and style among the various early\ncopies, a fact that points to a common origin. Specifically, all the copies share\nthe same nucleus of stories, which must have formed the original and which\nappear in the present translation. The only exception is the “Story of Qamar\nal-Zaman,” of which only the first few pages are extant in any Syrian\nmanuscript, and for this reason I have not included it in the present\ntranslation.\nFrom the archetype there evolved two separate branches of manuscripts,\nthe Syrian and the Egyptian.

It is of all existing manuscripts the oldest\nand the closest to the original, having been written sometime during the\nfourteenth century. The other three Syrian manuscripts were copied much\nlater, in the sixteenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, respectively. Theyare, however, very close to the fourteenth-century manuscript and similarly\ncontain only the nucleus and the very first part of “Qamar al-Zaman.”\nIf the Syrian branch shows a fortunately stunted growth that helped\npreserve the original, the Egyptian branch, on the contrary, shows a\nproliferation that produced an abundance of poisonous fruits that proved\nalmost fatal to the original.

Second, these copies delete or modify passages that exist in the\nSyrian manuscripts, add others, and indiscriminately borrow from each other.\nThird, the copyists, driven to complete one thousand and one nights, kept\nadding folk tales, fables, and anecdotes from Indian, Persian, and Turkish, as\nwell as indigenous sources, both from the oral and from the written traditions.\nOne such example is the story of Sindbad, which, though early in date, is a\nlater addition.

This is the more significant because the Ottoman period is\nmarked by a sharp decline in Arabic culture in general and literature in\nparticular.\nThe mania for collecting more stories and “completing” the work led\nsome copyists to resort even to forgery. Such is the case of none other than\n“The Story of Aladdin and the Magic Lamp.” This story is not among the\neleven basic stories of the original work, nor does it appear in any known\nArabic manuscript or edition, save in two, both written in Paris, long after it\nhad appeared in Galland’s translation.

Galland himself, as his diaries indicate,\nfirst heard the story in 1709 from Hanna Diab, a Maromite Christian of\nAleppo, who may have subsequently written it down and given it to Galland\nfor his translation. The first time the story appeared in Arabic was in 1787, in\na manuscript written by a Syrian Christian priest living in Paris, named\nDionysius Shawish, alias Dom Denis Chavis, a manuscript designed to\ncomplete the missing portions of the fourteenth-century Syrian manuscript.The story appeared again in a manuscript written between 1805 and 1808, in\nParis, by Mikhail Sabbagh, a Syrian collaborator of Silvestre de Sacy.\nSabbagh claimed to have copied it in turn from a Baghdad manuscript written\nin 1703.

Such good fortune, in retrieving not one but two versions of a lost\nwonderful tale, might be cause for rejoicing, as it indeed was among the\nscholars. However, a careful examination of the two versions, both in the\nlight of the general style of the \nNights\n and in the light of Galland’s\ntranslation, leads to a less joyful conclusion. Chavis fabricated the text by\ntranslating Galland back into Arabic, as is manifest from his French syntax\nand turns of phrase, and Sabbagh perpetuated the hoax by improving\nChavis’s translation and claiming it to be a Baghdad version. And this\nforgery was the source used by Payne and Burton for their own translations\nof the story.\nThe Printed Editions\nIF THE HISTORY of the manuscripts is a confusing tale, that of the printed\neditions of \nThe Thousand and One Nights\n is a sad comedy of errors.

    "IF THE HISTORY of the manuscripts is a confusing tale, that of the printed\neditions of \nThe Thousand and One Nights\n is a sad comedy of errors. The first\nedition was published by Fort William College in Calcutta, in two volumes\ncomprising the first two hundred nights (vol. 1 in 1814; vol. 2 in 1818). The\neditor was one Shaikh Ahmad ibn-Mahmud Shirawani, an instructor of\nArabic at the college. He pieced this edition together from a late Syrian\nmanuscript and a work containing classical anecdotes, choosing the texts at\nrandom. He deleted, added, and modified numerous passages and tried to\nchange, whenever he could, the colloquial to literary expres-sions. He edited\nas he pleased. Then came the Breslau edition, the first eight volumes of\nwhich were published by Maximilian Habicht, between 1824 and 1838, and\nthe last four by Heinrich Fleischer, between 1842 and 1843.

For reasons\nknown only to himself, Professor Habicht claimed to have based his edition\nnot on a Syrian or an Egyptian but on a Tunisian manuscript, thus confusing\nthe scholars until they finally disproved the claim by discovering that he had\npatched the text together from copies of the fourteenth-century Syrian\nmanuscript and late Egyptian ones.\nIt was on such a late Egyptian manuscript that the first Bulaq edition of\n1835 was exclusively based. It is a manuscript whose copyist, by culling,\ncollecting, and interpolating numerous tales of recent vintage and written in alate style, swelled the old text, and by subdividing the material, obtained one\nthousand and one nights, thus producing a “complete” version of the \nNights\n,\na version very different from the Mamluk original in substance, form, and\nstyle.

The Bulaq editor, Abd al-Rahman al-Safti Al-Sharqawi, not content to\nedit and print an accurate text of the manuscript, took it upon himself to\ncorrect, emend, and improve the language, producing a work that was in his\njudgment superior in literary quality to the original. Then came the second\nCalcutta edition, published in four volumes by William Macnaghten, between\n1839 and 1842. Edited by several hands, it was based on a late Egyptian\nmanuscript copied in 1829, with interpolations and with “corrections” in the\nsubstance and the style, according to the first Calcutta and the Breslau\neditions. Thus “thoroughly edited” and “completed,” as its editors claimed, it\nhas ever since vied with the Bulaq edition in the estimation of scholars and\ngeneral readers, not to mention all the major translators.

This is curious yet\nunderstandable as one of the anomalies of comparative cultural studies.\nWhile the history of textual scholarship in the West has been, since the\nRenaissance, increasingly one of keen accuracy and authenticity, its\ncounterpart in the East, especially in the case of the \nNights\n, has b",
    "story of textual scholarship in the West has been, since the\nRenaissance, increasingly one of keen accuracy and authenticity, its\ncounterpart in the East, especially in the case of the \nNights\n, has been one of\nerror and corruption, at the hands of Eastern and Western scholars alike, the\nresult of ignorance and contempt. It is all the more gratifying, therefore, that\nthe most recent edition of the Arabic text of the \nNights\n should be by far the\nbest. After years of sifting, analyzing, and collating virtually all available\ntexts, Muhsin Mahdi has published the definitive edition of the fourteenth-\ncentury Syrian manuscript in the Bibliothèque Nationale (\nAlf Layla wa Layla\n,\nLeiden, 1984). Mahdi fills lacunae, emends corruptions, and elucidates\nobscurities; however, he refrains from providing punctuation and diacriticalmarks or corrected spellings.

What emerges is a coherent and precise work of\nart that, unlike other versions, is like a restored icon or musical score, without\nthe added layers of paint or distortions, hence, as close to the original as\npossible. Thus a long-standing grievance has been finally redressed, and\nredressed with a sense of poetic justice, not only because this edition redeems\nall others from a general curse, but also because it is the work of a man who\nis at once the product of East and West. And it is particularly gratifying to me\npersonally, because it has provided me with the text for my translation.\nPast Translations\nNOT SO FORTUNATE were the major translators of the work into English,\nEdward Lane (1839–41), John Payne (1882–84), and Richard Burton (1885–\n86).

Lane based his translation on the Bulaq, the first Calcutta, and the\nBreslau; Payne on the second Calcutta and the Breslau; and Burton on the\nBulaq, the second Calcutta, and the Breslau editions. These translators did\nnot, as one might expect, compare the various editions to establish an\naccurate text for their translations (assuming that, given what they had, such a\ntask was possible); instead they deleted and added at random, or at will, from\nthe various sources to piece together a text that suited their individual\npurposes: in the case of Lane, a detailed but expurgated version; in the case\nof Payne and Burton, versions that are as full and complete as possible. In\neffect, they followed the same Arabic editorial tradition, except that whereas\nthe editors of Bulaq and Calcutta produced a corrupt text in Arabic, the\ntranslators of London produced an even more corrupt text in English. Even\nthe two less significant twentieth-century translations followed this pattern.\nE",
    "lcutta produced a corrupt text in Arabic, the\ntranslators of London produced an even more corrupt text in English. Even\nthe two less significant twentieth-century translations followed this pattern.\nEdward Poweys Mather based his English version (Routledge, 1937) on a\nFrench translation by J. C. Mardrus, which was based on the Bulaq and\nsecond Calcutta editions. Since he knew no Arabic, he altered the French\ntext, ignorant of what he was doing to the Arabic or how far he had strayed\nfrom it. And N. J. Dawood, who translated a selection of tales (Penguin,\n1956), which includes less than three of the eleven basic stories of the \nNights\n,\nfollowed the second Calcutta, “editing” and “correcting” here and there in the\nlight of the Bulaq edition.\nInterestingly, the only exception to this pattern is Galland himself, the\nvery first to translate the work in Europe (1704–17).

His French translation ofthe basic stories was based on none other than the fourteenth-century Syrian\ntext, as well as other sources. But instead of following the text faithfully,\nGalland deleted, added, and altered drastically to produce not a translation,\nbut a French adaptation, or rather a work of his own creation. He did succeed,\nhowever, in establishing the work as a classic, for no sooner had his\ntranslation begun to appear than a Grub Street English version followed\n(1706–8), went into many editions, and was itself followed by other\ntranslations, pseudotranslations, and imitations, so numerous that by 1800\nthere were more than eighty such collections.

The \nNights\n could shine in the dark.\nThese translators did not deviate from the letter of the original because\nthey did not know sufficient Arabic. On the contrary, a careful comparison\nbetween any given Arabic passage and their own respective translation of it\nreveals an admirable command of Arabic diction, grammar, and syntax,\nexcept where the text itself poses severe problems, as it often does. Although\nthe tales are generally written in the conversational style of the storyteller,\nthey modulate between the colloquial and the literary, and even ornate, within\na given passage, from passage to passage, and from story to story, and both\ntypes pose problems in regards to diction, grammar, and syntax. A great\nmany words are thirteenth-century Syrian and Egyptian colloquial idioms,\nwhich have long since disappeared from usage or whose meanings have been\naltered; and many others are of Persian origin, either used w",
    "rds are thirteenth-century Syrian and Egyptian colloquial idioms,\nwhich have long since disappeared from usage or whose meanings have been\naltered; and many others are of Persian origin, either used without alteration\nor Arabized. The sentences are often ungrammatical, hence capable of several\ndifferent and often contradictory readings. The typical structure is that of an\ninterminable running sentence, consisting of brief coordinated clauses, often\nwithout apparent regard for place, time, or causality. The translator is\ntherefore forced to interpret and reorder the clauses in a subordinated and\nlogical sequence, in order to suit the European habits of reading and thinking,\nif his reader is to understand the passage at all. To make matters worse, the\ntext, including Mahdi’s, normally bears neither diacritical nor punctuation\nmarks. In Arabic, the diacritical marks distinguish one letter from another,\nthus differentiating between words that share the same letters but have\ndifferent roots",
    "neither diacritical nor punctuation\nmarks. In Arabic, the diacritical marks distinguish one letter from another,\nthus differentiating between words that share the same letters but have\ndifferent roots and therefore different meanings. Thus a word may offer two\nvery different readings in a given sentence. This is not a problem when one ofthe meanings is unlikely in the context, but when both are possible, the\ntranslator must choose a single interpretation. The diacritical marks also\nindicate the forms of conjugation and declension. Their absence, therefore,\ncoupled with the faulty grammar of some sentences, makes every sentence an\nencounter, assuming, that is, that one always knows where a sentence or a\nunit of expression begins or ends, for the Arabic text uses no punctuation, not\neven question marks.\nWhat makes a coherent reading or translation of such a text possible is\nan eye familiar with Arabic prose and an ear attuned to the rhythm of the\nspoken language, ideally the eye and ear ",
    "stion marks.\nWhat makes a coherent reading or translation of such a text possible is\nan eye familiar with Arabic prose and an ear attuned to the rhythm of the\nspoken language, ideally the eye and ear of someone who reads, writes, and\nspeaks Arabic like a native. It is a wonder, therefore, that foreign translators,\nlike Lane, Payne, and Burton, made so few mistakes, yet no wonder that they\nmade them. In diction, for instance, when they met words they could not\nunderstand, they often dropped them from their text. In grammar, a\nmisreading, for instance, of the conjugation of the verb “to overtake,” which\nalso means “to realize,” leads Burton to translate the refrain “But morning\novertook Shahrazad, and she lapsed into silence,” as “And Shahrazad\nperceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.” This\nexample would seem innocuous enough were it not that it is repeated one\nthousand times and were it not that it spoils the dramatic poignancy of the\nsituation, when the morning, t",

In syntax, reordering the clauses for a coherent reading often\nrequires knowledge of Arab life and culture. For example, the following\npassage, translated literally, reads:\nAfter a while, our mother also died, and left us three thousand dinars,\nwhich we divided equally among ourselves. I was the youngest. My two\nsisters prepared their dowries and got married.\nBurton translates it as follows:\nAfter a while my mother also deceased, leaving me and my sisters-\ngerman three thousand dinars; so each daughter received her portion of a\nthousand dinars and I the same, albe’ the youngest. In due course of\ntime, my sisters married with the usual festivities.\nBut it should read:After a while, our mother also died, leaving us three thousand d",
    "and dinars and I the same, albe’ the youngest. In due course of\ntime, my sisters married with the usual festivities.\nBut it should read:After a while, our mother also died, leaving us three thousand dinars,\nwhich we divided equally among ourselves. Since I was the youngest of\nthe three, my two sisters prepared their dowries and got married before\nme.\nFor what is at issue here is not the Islamic law of inheritance but marriage\ncustoms in Arab society.\nMoreover, the problem for the translators was compounded in that, as\noften as not, a given passage had already been altered by the editor of a\nmanuscript or a printed edition or by both. For the tales, for all their\npopularity among the people, were regarded with condescension and\ncontempt by the Arab literati of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\nThese included the editors themselves, self-appointed men of taste and\njudgment, who, trained during the period of the decline of Arabic literature,\nhad little judgment and no taste.

But such adherence is not the only cause of\ntheir violation of the spirit; another and more fundamental cause lay in their\nrespective views of the work itself, their objectives in translating it, and their\nstrategies and styles, all of which may be explained by the fact that they\nsimply failed to see that fidelity to the precise detail was crucial to achievethe essential quality of the \nNights\n, by bridging the gap between the natural\nand the supernatural.\nFrom ",

Time and\nagain, Galland, Lane, or Burton claimed that these tales were much more\naccurate than any travel account and took pains to translate them as such. For\nthis purpose, each of them adopts a specific strategy, depending on his other\nintentions. Lane translates the work as a travel guide to Cairo, Damascus, and\nBaghdad. In order to substantiate this claim, he adds compendious notes\nintended to explain a given passage and to introduce the reader to various\naspects of Arab culture, such as social customs, mythology, religion, and\nethics, without asking himself whether such subst",

Consequently, he proceeds to depict this\nlife in an accessibly plain style, much more faithful to the conversational\nstyle of the original than, say, the style of Burton. But instead of being\nfaithful to the life depicted in the tales, Lane omits sometimes a few details,\nsometimes whole passages, curiously because he finds them inconsistent with\nhis own observations of life in Cairo. For instance, he omits the details of the\ndrinking scene in “The Story of the Porter and the Three Ladies,” because he\nhas never seen Cairene ladies drink, but, to make sure that the reader is\nproperly informed, he appends a twenty-page footnote dealing with drinking\nhabits among the Arabs.

Then he goes on to explain that such passages, like\nthe one he has omitted, “seem as if they were introduced for the gratification\nof the lowest class of auditors of a public reciter of a coffee-shop. These\npassages exhibit to us persons of high rank, both men and women, as\ncharacterized by a grossness which is certainly not uncommon among Arabs\nof the inferior classes” (ch. 10, n. 87). He also omits the verse passages,\nexcept for a token line here and there, because he finds them to be for the\nmost part either worthless or obscure, and because in truth they do not suit his\nsociological purpose. He is an orientalist or a sociologist, rather than a\nstoryteller.\nIf Lane attempts to guide the prudish Victorian reader through Cairo by\nintroducing him to a higher class of Egyptian society, Burton attempts to\nbring Cairo, in all its color, to England.

    ".\nIf Lane attempts to guide the prudish Victorian reader through Cairo by\nintroducing him to a higher class of Egyptian society, Burton attempts to\nbring Cairo, in all its color, to England. But unlike Lane, who is interested inwhat he considers to be typical manifestations of Arab culture, Burton is\ninterested in the exotic, the quaint, and the colorful. He too appends copious\nnotes, but these are meant to appeal to Victorian prurience or to shock\nprudish sensibility. Typical is the note on the passage in the “Prologue,” in\nwhich Shahrayar’s wife lies on her back and invites the black slave Mas’ud to\nmake love to her while ten other black slaves are busy making love to ten of\nher female attendants; Burton explains the white woman’s predilection for\nblack men by expatiating on the efficacy of the enormous male organs in\nZanzibar, promising the reader to regale him on the retention of the semen, in\ndue course.\nBurton declares in the introduction that his purpose is to produce a “full,\nc",

The literary is marked by metaphors and similes,\nformulaic epithets, parallelisms, and rhymed prose, and Burton literally\npreserves all this, including the jingling rhymes, merrily telling the reader\nthat he has “carefully Englished the picturesque turns and novel expressions\nof the original in all their outlandishness.” And outlandish, indeed grotesque,\nthey appear, both to English and to Arabic eyes.

    ", Burton\nis unable to retrench in his rendering of the colloquial passages; therefore, he\nrenders them in a pseudo-archaic style dear to the heart of many a Victorian\ntranslator, a style that is totally alien both to the style of the Arabic original\nand to any recognizable style in English literature. One may suppose that\nBurton follows a general Victorian tendency to archaize and make more\ncolorful the “rude” works of primitive times and places; and subsequently\none may trace the same tendency in the style of Payne’s translation of the\nNights\n, in which Burton detects and admires a “sub-flavor of the\nMabinogianic archaism.” But even a cursory comparison easily shows that\nthe style of Payne’s translation, which was unfortunately published in a\nlimited edition of five hundred copies and was therefore unavailable to the\ngeneral reader, is by far more successful than Burton’s in reproducing both\nthe letter and the spirit of the original. But what is more to the point here is\nthat a carefu",

But what is more to the point here is\nthat a careful and thorough comparison between Burton and Payne explains\nanother reason for Burton’s choice of style. He himself admits in the\nintroduction that Payne “uses the exact vernacular equivalent of the foreignword so happily and so picturesquely that all future translations must perforce\nuse the same expression.” Burton consistently follows Payne’s translation,\ncopying it almost verbatim but adding his own sauce and spices.\nThus Burton’s translation is akin to that of Galland, at least in one\nrespect, for it is not so much a true translation of the \nNights\n as it is a colorful\nand entertaining concoction. For instance, a passage that reads:\nThe curtain was unfastened, and a dazzling girl emerged, with genial\ncharm, wise mien, and features as radiant as the moon. She had an\nelegant figure, the",

She had an\nelegant figure, the scent of ambergris, sugared lips, Babylonian eyes,\nwith eyebrows as arched as a pair of bent bows, and a face whose\nradiance put the shining sun to shame, for she was like a great star\nsoaring in the heavens, or a dome of gold, or an unveiled bride, or a\nsplendid fish swimming in a fountain, or a morsel of luscious fat in a\nbowl of milk soup,\nbecomes in Burton’s hands:\nThereupon sat a lady bright of blee, with brow beaming brilliancy, the\ndream of philosophy, whose eyes were fraught with Babel’s gramarye\nand her eyebrows were arched as for archery; her breath breathed\nambergris and perfumery and her lips were sugar to taste and carnelian\nto see.

Her stature was straight as the letter I and her face shamed the\nnoon-sun’s radiancy; and she was even as a galaxy, or a dome with\ngolden marquetry or a bride displayed in choicest finery or a noble maid\nof Araby.\nAnother passage, which reads:\nWhen I saw that he was dead and realized that it was I who had killed\nhim, I let out a loud scream, beat my face, tore my clothes, and cried, “O\npeople, O God’s creatures, there remained for this young man only one\nday out of the forty, yet he still met his death at my hand. O God, I ask\nfor your forgiveness, wishing that I had died before him. These my\nafflictions I suffer, draught by bitter draught, ‘so that God’s will may be\nfulfilled.’”\nbecomes almost a parody or rather a self-parody:When I saw that he was slain and knew that I had slain him, maugre\nmyself, I cried out with an exceeding loud and bitter cry and beat my\nface and rent my raiment and said, ‘Verily we be Allah’s and unto Him\nw",

In translating the work as they did, they\nviolated its integrity—Lane by emasculating it; Burton by reproducing its\nArabic peculiarities and adding other idiosyncrasies of his own; and Galland\nby altering it to suit French taste, although this method comes the closest to\nproducing the intended effect.

In converting the meaning\nof the text, the translators, who must act both as editors and as interpreters,\noffer a reading of it, designed for a given reader in a given language, and in\nthe context of a given culture. They try to achieve equivalency, but since, due\nto the untranslatable difference in cultural connotations, associations, and\nother nuances, full equivalency is impossible, the translators try to achieve\napproximation by securing a willing suspension of disbelief that allows thereader to believe that the translated text is the original text. This is possible,\nespecially since in literature, the translators must convey not only the\nmeaning of the text but also its aesthetic effect on readers.

They respond to\nthe text as natives would, by identifying the means by which this effect is\nproduced, and by finding the comparable linguistic and literary means\navailable in the host culture to produce a comparable effect in the intended\nreader. Therefore, they should not, as translators from Dryden to Burton have\nadvocated, try to write as the original author would have written in the host\nlanguage, for such a creature can never be; instead, they should try to produce\nan equivalent text that will produce an effect on the intended reader\ncomparable to the effect the original text produces on the native reader. For\nthe aesthetic effect, which is grounded in human nature and which can be\nachieved by our knowledge of and skill in using the tools of the respective\nliterary conventions, is the common denominator between the native and the\nhost culture and the principal means of success in transferring the literary\nwork from one context to another.\nThe Prose\nIN T",

Such\nadherence has been the underlying principle of my translation. This does not\nmean, however, that I have taken liberties with the text; on the contrary, I\nhave been as faithful as possible, except for very few interpolations (placed in\nbrackets) without which the gaps would have rendered the narrative illogical,\nand except when literal fidelity would have meant deviating from the limits\nof idiomatic English and consequently violating the spirit or the intended\neffect of the original.

Likewise, I have used literary\nornament judiciously because what appealed to Arabic thirteenth- or\nfourteenth-century literary taste does not always appeal to the taste of the\nmodern English reader. For instance, I have avoided the rhymed prose of the\noriginal because it is too artificial and too jarring to the English ear.\nFurthermore, I have varied the level of the style to suit the level of a\ngiven story, a lower level for some of the comic tales of “The Story of the\nHunchback,” and a higher level for “The Story of Nur al-Din ibn-Bakkar and\nthe Slave-Girl Shams al-Nahar,” a story written in thirteenth-century\nBaghdad, with literary echoes from the highly euphuistic and popular\nMaqamat\n of Hariri. Finally, I have avoided the temptation to add a distinctive\ncolor or stamp a personal manner or mannerism on the original in order to\nappeal to the reader.

    "ersonal manner or mannerism on the original in order to\nappeal to the reader. Burton’s case is sobering enough; besides, the intention\nof the style of the \nNights\n is to provide the storyteller or the reader with the\nopportunity to tell or read the story in his own voice and to dramatize the\naction and dialogue in his own way, very much as the actors do when they\nbring their written parts to life. Neutrality is crucial here.\nThe Verse\nONE OF THE distinctive features of the \nNights\n is that the prose narrative is\ninterspersed with verse passages, some of which were interpolated by the\noriginal editor, some by subsequent copyists. They are inserted to suit the\noccasion, and whether adding color to the description of a place or a person,\nexpressing joy or grief, complimenting a lady, or underscoring a moral, they\nare intended to heighten the action, raise the literary level, and intensify the\nemotional effect.

    "scoring a moral, they\nare intended to heighten the action, raise the literary level, and intensify the\nemotional effect. Yet a great number of these passages fail to achieve such\neffects because they are too mediocre, for less than one-half are anthologized\nfrom the classical poets of the period down to the fourteenth century, while\nthe rest are composed by lesser versifiers, including hacks and even the\ncopyists themselves.\nIn general, the verse is characterized by poetic diction, comparisons,\nmetaphors, conceits, and all kinds of parallelisms, especially balanced\nantitheses. For this reason, I have adopted a style similar to that of neoclassic\npoetry, particularly because, like its Arabic counterpart, it was ultimately\nderived from the same source, namely the Greco-Roman tradition; besides, atraditional Arabic poem consists of lines, each of which comprises two equal\nhalves and follows the same rhyme throughout, thus producing an effect akin\nto that of the heroic couplet.

In the case of the love lyrics, I have drawn on the\ntradition of courtly compliment, imitating one type or another depending on\nthe freedom or emotional intensity of the Arabic lyric in question.\nMy main problem was how to render the turgid or vapid verse passages\nof the lesser versifiers, which are marked by artificial word order, forced\nrhymes, inexact parallelisms, and hackneyed metaphors.

I have decided in favor of the latter\nand have rendered each passage as it is, making it appear neither better nor\nworse. Thus the original discrepancy between the good and the bad is\nmaintained. For instance, a classic passage reads:\nIf you suffer injustice, save yourself,\nAnd leave the house behind to mourn its builder.\nYour country you’ll replace by another,\nBut for yourself you’ll find no other self.\nNor with a mission trust another man,\nFor none is as loyal as you yourself.\nAnd did the lion not struggle by himself,\nHe would not prowl with such a mighty mane.\nwhile that of a hack versifier reads:\nIf I bemoan your absence, what will you say?\nIf I pine with longing, what is the way?\nIf I dispatch someone to tell my tale,\nThe lover’s complaint no one can convey.If I with patience try to bear my pain,\nAfter the loss of love, I c",

The older brother was named Shahrayar, the\nyounger Shahzaman. The older, Shahrayar, was a towering knight and a\ndaring champion, invincible, energetic, and implacable. His power reached\nthe remotest corners of the land and its people, so that the country was loyal\nto him, and his subjects obeyed him. Shahrayar himself lived and ruled in\nIndia and Indochina, while to his brother he gave the land of Samarkand to\nrule as king.\nTen years went by, when one day Shahrayar felt a longing for his\nbrother the king, summoned his vizier\n3\n (who h",
    "ndia and Indochina, while to his brother he gave the land of Samarkand to\nrule as king.\nTen years went by, when one day Shahrayar felt a longing for his\nbrother the king, summoned his vizier\n3\n (who had two daughters, one called\nShahrazad, the other Dinarzad) and bade him go to his brother. Having made\npreparations, the vizier journeyed day and night until he reached Samarkand.\nWhen Shahzaman heard of the vizier’s arrival, he went out with his retainers\nto meet him. He dismounted, embraced him, and asked him for news from his\nolder brother, Shahrayar. The vizier replied that he was well, and that he had\nsent him to request his brother to visit him. Shahzaman complied with his\nbrother’s request and proceeded to make preparations for the journey. In the\nmeantime, he had the vizier camp on the outskirts of the city, and took care of\nhis needs. He sent him what he required of food and fodder, slaughtered\nmany sheep in his honor, and provided him with money and supplies, as well\nas many hor",
    "e outskirts of the city, and took care of\nhis needs. He sent him what he required of food and fodder, slaughtered\nmany sheep in his honor, and provided him with money and supplies, as well\nas many horses and camels.\nFor ten full days he prepared himself for the journey; then he appointed\na chamberlain in his place, and left the city to spend the night in his tent, near\nthe vizier. At midnight he returned to his palace in the city, to bid his wife\ngood-bye. But when he entered the palace, he found his wife lying in the\narms of one of the kitchen boys. When he saw them, the world turned dark\nbefore his eyes and, shaking his head, he said to himself, “I am still here, and\nthis is what she has done when I was barely outside the city. How will it be\nand what will happen behind my back when I go to visit my brother in India?No. Women are not to be trusted.” He got exceedingly angry, adding, “By\nGod, I am king and sovereign in Samarkand, yet my wife has betrayed me\nand has inflicted this on m",
    " to visit my brother in India?No. Women are not to be trusted.” He got exceedingly angry, adding, “By\nGod, I am king and sovereign in Samarkand, yet my wife has betrayed me\nand has inflicted this on me.” As his anger boiled, he drew his sword and\nstruck both his wife and the cook. Then he dragged them by the heels and\nthrew them from the top of the palace to the trench below. He then left the\ncity and, going to the vizier, ordered that they depart that very hour. The\ndrum was struck, and they set out on their journey, while Shahzaman’s heart\nwas on fire because of what his wife had done to him and how she had\nbetrayed him with some cook, some kitchen boy. They journeyed hurriedly,\nday and night, through deserts and wilds, until they reached the land of King\nShahrayar, who had gone out to receive them.\nWhen Shahrayar met them, he embraced his brother, showed him favors,\nand treated him generously. He offered him quarters in a palace adjoining his\nown, for King Shahrayar had built two be",
    "eceive them.\nWhen Shahrayar met them, he embraced his brother, showed him favors,\nand treated him generously. He offered him quarters in a palace adjoining his\nown, for King Shahrayar had built two beautiful towering palaces in his\ngarden, one for the guests, the other for the women and members of his\nhousehold. He gave the guest house to his brother, Shahzaman, after the\nattendants had gone to scrub it, dry it, furnish it, and open its windows, which\noverlooked the garden. Thereafter, Shahzaman would spend the whole day at\nhis brother’s, return at night to sleep at the palace, then go back to his brother\nthe next morning. But whenever he found himself alone and thought of his\nordeal with his wife, he would sigh deeply, then stifle his grief, and say,\n“Alas, that this great misfortune should have happened to one in my\nposition!” Then he would fret with anxiety, his spirit would sag, and he\nwould say, “None has seen what I have seen.” In his depression, he ate less\nand less, grew pale, ",
    "ld have happened to one in my\nposition!” Then he would fret with anxiety, his spirit would sag, and he\nwould say, “None has seen what I have seen.” In his depression, he ate less\nand less, grew pale, and his health deteriorated. He neglected everything,\nwasted away, and looked ill.\nWhen King Shahrayar looked at his brother and saw how day after day\nhe lost weight and grew thin, pale, ashen, and sickly, he thought that this was\nbecause of his expatriation and homesickness for his country and his family,\nand he said to himself, “My brother is not happy here. I should prepare a\ngoodly gift for him and send him home.” For a month he gathered gifts for\nhis brother; then he invited him to see him and said, “Brother, I would like\nyou to know that I intend to go hunting and pursue the roaming deer, for ten\ndays. Then I shall return to prepare you for your journey home. Would you\nlike to go hunting with me?” Shahzaman replied, “Brother, I feel distractedand depressed. Leave me here and go with ",
    ", for ten\ndays. Then I shall return to prepare you for your journey home. Would you\nlike to go hunting with me?” Shahzaman replied, “Brother, I feel distractedand depressed. Leave me here and go with God’s blessing and help.” When\nShahrayar heard his brother, he thought that his dejection was because of his\nhomesickness for his country. Not wishing to coerce him, he left him behind,\nand set out with his retainers and men. When they entered the wilderness, he\ndeployed his men in a circle to begin trapping and hunting.\nAfter his brother’s departure, Shahzaman stayed in the palace and, from\nthe window overlooking the garden, watched the birds and trees as he thought\nof his wife and what she had done to him, and sighed in sorrow. While he\nagonized over his misfortune, gazing at the heavens and turning a distracted\neye on the garden, the private gate of his brother’s palace opened, and there\nemerged, strutting like a dark-eyed deer, the lady, his brother’s wife, with\ntwenty slave-girls, ten",
    " turning a distracted\neye on the garden, the private gate of his brother’s palace opened, and there\nemerged, strutting like a dark-eyed deer, the lady, his brother’s wife, with\ntwenty slave-girls, ten white and ten black. While Shahzaman looked at them,\nwithout being seen, they continued to walk until they stopped below his\nwindow, without looking in his direction, thinking that he had gone to the\nhunt with his brother. Then they sat down, took off their clothes, and\nsuddenly there were ten slave-girls and ten black slaves dressed in the same\nclothes as the girls. Then the ten black slaves mounted the ten girls, while the\nlady called, “Mas’ud, Mas’ud!” and a black slave jumped from the tree to the\nground, rushed to her, and, raising her legs, went between her thighs and\nmade love to her. Mas’ud topped the lady, while the ten slaves topped the ten\ngirls, and they carried on till noon. When they were done with their business,\nthey got up and washed themselves.

Then the ten slaves put on the same\nclothes again, mingled with the girls, and once more there appeared to be\ntwenty slave-girls. Mas’ud himself jumped over the garden wall and\ndisappeared, while the slave-girls and the lady sauntered to the private gate,\nwent in and, locking the gate behind them, went their way.\nAll of this happened under King Shahzaman’s eyes. When he saw this\nspectacle of the wife and the women of his brother the great king—how ten\nslaves put on women’s clothes and slept with his brother’s paramours and\nconcubines and what Mas’ud did with his brother’s wife, in his very palace—\nand pondered over this calamity and great misfortune, his care and sorrow\nleft him and he said to himself, “This is our common lot.

    " calamity and great misfortune, his care and sorrow\nleft him and he said to himself, “This is our common lot. Even though my\nbrother is king and master of the whole world, he cannot protect what is his,\nhis wife and his concubines, and suffers misfortune in his very home. What\nhappened to me is little by comparison. I used to think that I was the only onewho has suffered, but from what I have seen, everyone suffers. By God, my\nmisfortune is lighter than that of my brother.” He kept marveling and blaming\nlife, whose trials none can escape, and he began to find consolation in his\nown affliction and forget his grief. When supper came, he ate and drank with\nrelish and zest and, feeling better, kept eating and drinking, enjoying himself\nand feeling happy. He thought to himself, “I am no longer alone in my\nmisery; I am well.”\nFor ten days, he continued to enjoy his food and drink, and when his\nbrother, King Shahrayar, came back from the hunt, he met him happily,\ntreated him attentively, and ",
    "alone in my\nmisery; I am well.”\nFor ten days, he continued to enjoy his food and drink, and when his\nbrother, King Shahrayar, came back from the hunt, he met him happily,\ntreated him attentively, and greeted him cheerfully. His brother, King\nShahrayar, who had missed him, said, “By God, brother, I missed you on this\ntrip and wished you were with me.” Shahzaman thanked him and sat down to\ncarouse with him, and when night fell, and food was brought before them, the\ntwo ate and drank, and again Shahzaman ate and drank with zest. As time\nwent by, he continued to eat and drink with appetite, and became lighthearted\nand carefree. His face regained color and became ruddy, and his body gained\nweight, as his blood circulated and he regained his energy; he was himself\nagain, or even better. King Shahrayar noticed his brother’s condition, how he\nused to be and how he had improved, but kept it to himself until he took him\naside one day and said, “My brother Shahzaman, I would like you to do\nsometh",
    "hrayar noticed his brother’s condition, how he\nused to be and how he had improved, but kept it to himself until he took him\naside one day and said, “My brother Shahzaman, I would like you to do\nsomething for me, to satisfy a wish, to answer a question truthfully.”\nShahzaman asked, “What is it, brother?” He replied, “When you first came to\nstay with me, I noticed that you kept losing weight, day after day, until your\nlooks changed, your health deteriorated, and your energy sagged. As you\ncontinued like this, I thought that what ailed you was your homesickness for\nyour family and your country, but even though I kept noticing that you were\nwasting away and looking ill, I refrained from questioning you and hid my\nfeelings from you. Then I went hunting, and when I came back, I found that\nyou had recovered and had regained your health. Now I want you to tell me\neverything and to explain the cause of your deterioration and the cause of\nyour subsequent recovery, without hiding anything from me",
    "d recovered and had regained your health. Now I want you to tell me\neverything and to explain the cause of your deterioration and the cause of\nyour subsequent recovery, without hiding anything from me.” When\nShahzaman heard what King Shahrayar said, he bowed his head, then said,\n“As for the cause of my recovery, that I cannot tell you, and I wish that you\nwould excuse me from telling you.” The king was greatly astonished at his\nbrother’s reply and, burning with curiosity, said, “You must tell me. For now,at least, explain the first cause.”\nThen Shahzaman related to his brother what happened to him with his\nown wife, on the night of his departure, from beginning to end, and\nconcluded, “Thus all the while I was with you, great King, whenever I\nthought of the event and the misfortune that had befallen me, I felt troubled,\ncareworn, and unhappy, and my health deteriorated. This then is the cause.”\nThen he grew silent. When King Shahrayar heard his brother’s explanation,\nhe shook his head, ",

When King Shahrayar heard his brother’s explanation,\nhe shook his head, greatly amazed at the deceit of women, and prayed to God\nto protect him from their wickedness, saying, “Brother, you were fortunate in\nkilling your wife and her lover, who gave you good reason to feel troubled,\ncareworn, and ill. In my opinion, what happened to you has never happened\nto anyone else. By God, had I been in your place, I would have killed at least\na hundred or even a thousand women. I would have been furious; I would\nhave gone mad. Now praise be to God who has delivered you from sorrow\nand distress. But tell me what has caused you to forget your sorrow and\nregain your health?” Shahzaman replied, “King, I wish that for God’s sake\nyou would excuse me from telling you.” Shahrayar said, “You must.”\nShahzaman replied, “I fear that you will feel even more troubled and\ncareworn than",
    "ahzaman replied, “King, I wish that for God’s sake\nyou would excuse me from telling you.” Shahrayar said, “You must.”\nShahzaman replied, “I fear that you will feel even more troubled and\ncareworn than I.” Shahrayar asked, “How could that be, brother? I insist on\nhearing your explanation.”\nShahzaman then told him about what he had seen from the palace\nwindow and the calamity in his very home—how ten slaves, dressed like\nwomen, were sleeping with his women and concubines, day and night. He\ntold him everything from beginning to end (but there is no point in repeating\nthat). Then he concluded, “When I saw your own misfortune, I felt better—\nand said to myself, ‘My brother is king of the world, yet such a misfortune\nhas happened to him, and in his very home.’ As a result I forgot my care and\nsorrow, relaxed, and began to eat and drink. This is the cause of my cheer and\ngood spirits.”\nWhen King Shahrayar heard what his brother said and found out what\nhad happened to him, he was furious and h",

This is the cause of my cheer and\ngood spirits.”\nWhen King Shahrayar heard what his brother said and found out what\nhad happened to him, he was furious and his blood boiled. He said, “Brother,\nI can’t believe what you say unless I see it with my own eyes.” When\nShahzaman saw that his brother was in a rage, he said to him, “If you do not\nbelieve me, unless you see your misfortune with your own eyes, announcethat you plan to go hunting. Then you and I shall set out with your troops,\nand when we get outside the city, we shall leave our tents and camp with the\nmen behind, enter the city secretly, and go together to your palace. Then the\nnext morning you can see with your own eyes.”\nKing Shahrayar realized that his brother had a good plan and ordered his\narmy to prepare for the trip. He spent the night with his brother, and when\nGod’s morning broke, the two rode out of the city with their army, preceded\nby the camp attendants, who had gone to drive",

At nightfall King Shahrayar\nsummoned his chief chamberlain and bade him take his place. He entrusted\nhim with the army and ordered that for three days no one was to enter the\ncity. Then he and his brother disguised themselves and entered the city in the\ndark. They went directly to the palace where Shahzaman resided and slept\nthere till the morning. When they awoke, they sat at the palace window,\nwatching the garden and chatting, until the light broke, the day dawned, and\nthe sun rose. As they watched, the private gate opened, and there emerged as\nusual the wife of King Shahrayar, walking among twenty slave girls.

They\nmade their way under the trees until they stood below the palace window\nwhere the two kings sat. Then they took off their women’s clothes, and\nsuddenly there were ten slaves, who mounted the ten girls and made love to\nthem. As for the lady, she called, “Mas’ud, Mas’ud,” and a black slave\njumped from the tree to the ground, came to her, and said, “What do you\nwant, you slut? Here is Sa’ad al-Din Mas’ud.” She laughed and fell on her\nback, while the slave mounted her and like the others did his business with\nher. Then the black slaves got up, washed themselves, and, putting on the\nsame clothes, mingled with the girls. Then they walked away, entered the\npalace, and locked the gate behind them.

Such doings are going on in\nmy kingdom, and in my very palace. Perish the world and perish life! This is\na great calamity, indeed.” Then he turned to his brother and asked, “Would\nyou like to follow me in what I shall do?” Shahzaman answered, “Yes. I\nwill.” Shahrayar said, “Let us leave our royal state and roam the world for thelove of the Supreme Lord. If we should find one whose misfortune is greater\nthan ours, we shall return. Otherwise, we shall continue to journey through\nthe land, without need for the trappings of royalty.” Shahzaman replied,\n“This is an excellent idea.

They slept over their sorrows, and in the morning\nresumed their day journey until they came to a meadow by the seashore.\nWhile they sat in the meadow amid the thick plants and trees, discussing their\nmisfortunes and the recent events, they suddenly heard a shout and a great\ncry coming from the middle of the sea. They trembled with fear, thinking that\nthe sky had fallen on the earth. Then the sea parted, and there emerged a\nblack pillar that, as it swayed forward, got taller and taller, until it touched the\nclouds. Shahrayar and Shahzaman were petrified; then they ran in terror and,\nclimbing a very tall tree, sat hiding in its foliage. When they looked again,\nthey saw that the black pillar was cleaving the sea, wading in the water\ntoward the green meadow, until it touched the shore. When they looked\nagain, they saw that it was a b",

When they looked\nagain, they saw that it was a black demon, carrying on his head a large glass\nchest with four steel locks. He came out, walked into the meadow, and where\nshould he stop but under the very tree where the two kings were hiding. The\ndemon sat down and placed the glass chest on the ground. He took out four\nkeys and, opening the locks of the chest, pulled out a full-grown woman. She\nhad a beautiful figure, and a face like the full moon, and a lovely smile. He\ntook her out, laid her under the tree, and looked at her, saying, “Mistress of\nall noble women, you whom I carried away on your wedding night, I would\nlike to sleep a little.” Then he placed his head on the young woman’s lap,\nstretched his legs to the sea, sank into sleep, and began to snore.\nMeanwhile, the woman looked up at the tree and, turning her head by\nchance, sa",

She lifted the demon’s\nhead from her lap and placed it on the ground. Then she came and stood\nunder the tree and motioned to them with her hand, as if to say, “Come down\nslowly to me.” When they realized that she had seen them, they were\nfrightened, and they begged her and implored her, in the name of the Creator\nof the heavens, to excuse them from climbing down. She replied, “You must\ncome down to me.” They motioned to her, saying, “This sleeping demon is\nthe enemy of mankind. For God’s sake, leave us alone.” She replied, “Youmust come down, and if you don’t, I shall wake the demon and have him kill\nyou.” She kept gesturing and pressing, until they climbed down very slowly\nand stood before her. Then she lay on her back, raised her legs, and said,\n“Make",
    "’t, I shall wake the demon and have him kill\nyou.” She kept gesturing and pressing, until they climbed down very slowly\nand stood before her. Then she lay on her back, raised her legs, and said,\n“Make love to me and satisfy my need, or else I shall wake the demon, and\nhe will kill you.” They replied, “For God’s sake, mistress, don’t do this to us,\nfor at this moment we feel nothing but dismay and fear of this demon. Please,\nexcuse us.” She replied, “You must,” and insisted, swearing, “By God who\ncreated the heavens, if you don’t do it, I shall wake my husband the demon\nand ask him to kill you and throw you into the sea.” As she persisted, they\ncould no longer resist and they made love to her, first the older brother, then\nthe younger. When they were done and withdrew from her, she said to them,\n“Give me your rings,” and, pulling out from the folds of her dress a small\npurse, opened it, and shook out ninety-eight rings of different fashions and\ncolors. Then she asked them, “Do you know ",

Then she asked them, “Do you know what these rings are?” They\nanswered, “No.” She said, “All the owners of these rings slept with me, for\nwhenever one of them made love to me, I took a ring from him. Since you\ntwo have slept with me, give me your rings, so that I may add them to the\nrest, and make a full hundred. A hundred men have known me under the very\nhorns of this filthy, monstrous cuckold, who has imprisoned me in this chest,\nlocked it with four locks, and kept me in the middle of this raging, roaring\nsea. He has guarded me and tried to keep me pure and chaste, not realizing\nthat nothing can prevent or alter what is predestined and that when a woman\ndesires something, no one can stop her.” When Shahrayar and Shahzaman\nheard what the young woman said, they were greatly amazed, danced with\njoy, and said, “O God, O God!",
    "estined and that when a woman\ndesires something, no one can stop her.” When Shahrayar and Shahzaman\nheard what the young woman said, they were greatly amazed, danced with\njoy, and said, “O God, O God! There is no power and no strength, save in\nGod the Almighty, the Magnificent. ‘Great is women’s cunning.’” Then each\nof them took off his ring and handed it to her. She took them and put them\nwith the rest in the purse. Then sitting again by the demon, she lifted his\nhead, placed it back on her lap, and motioned to them, “Go on your way, or\nelse I shall wake him.”\nThey turned their backs and took to the road. Then Shahrayar turned to\nhis brother and said, “My brother Shahzaman, look at this sorry plight. By\nGod, it is worse than ours. This is no less than a demon who has carried a\nyoung woman away on her wedding night, imprisoned her in a glass chest,\nlocked her up with four locks, and kept her in the middle of the sea, thinkingthat he could guard her from what God had foreordained, and y",

Brother, let us go back to our kingdoms and our cities, never\nto marry a woman again. As for myself, I shall show you what I will do.”\nThen the two brothers headed home and journeyed till nightfall. On the\nmorning of the third day, they reached their camp and men, entered their tent,\nand sat on their thrones. The chamberlains, deputies, princes, and viziers\ncame to attend King Shahrayar, while he gave orders and bestowed robes of\nhonor, as well as other gifts.

Then King Shahrayar grabbed his sword,\nbrandished it, and, entering the palace chambers, killed every one of his\nslave-girls and replaced them with others. He then swore to marry for one\nnight only and kill the woman the next morning, in order to save himself\nfrom the wicknedness and cunning of women, saying, “There is not a single\nchaste woman anywhere on the entire face of the earth.” Shortly thereafter he\nprovided his brother Shahzaman with supplies for his journey and sent him\nback to his own country with gifts, rarities, and money.

That very night he took one of his\narmy officers’ daughters, slept with her, and the next morning ordered the\nvizier to put her to death. The vizier, who could not disobey him, put her to\ndeath. The third night he took one of the merchants’ daughters, slept with her\ntill the morning, then ordered his vizier to put her to death, and the vizier did\nso.

The\nolder daughter, Shahrazad, had read the books of literature, philosophy, and\nmedicine. She knew poetry by heart, had studied historical reports, and was\nacquainted with the sayings of men and the maxims of sages and kings. She\nwas intelligent, knowledgeable, wise, and refined.

This merchant was taught the language of the beasts,\non condition that if he revealed his secret to anyone, he would die; therefore,\neven though he knew the language of every kind of animal, he did not let\nanyone know, for fear of death. One day, as he sat, with his wife beside him\nand his children playing before him, he glanced at an ox and a donkey he\nkept at the farmhouse, tied to adjacent troughs, and heard the ox say to the\ndonkey, “Watchful one, I hope that you are enjoying the comfort and the\nservice you are getting. Your ground is swept and watered, and they serve\nyou, feed you sifted barley, and offer you clear, cool water to drink. I, on the\ncontrary, am taken out to plow in the middle of the night.

You stand in comfort, save for the rare occasion when our master the\nmerchant rides you to do a brief errand and returns. You are comfortable,\nwhile I am weary; you sleep, while I keep awake.”\nWhen the ox finished, the donkey turned to him and said, “Greenhorn,\nthey were right in calling you ox, for you ox harbor no deceit, malice, or\nmeanness.

On the following day, the plowman came to the merchant’s\nhouse and, taking the ox, placed the yoke upon his neck and worked him at\nthe plow, but the ox lagged behind. The plowman hit him, but following the\ndonkey’s advice, the ox, dissembling, fell on his belly, and the plowman hit\nhim again. Thus the ox kept getting up and falling until nightfall, when the\nplowman took him home and tied him to the trough. But this time the ox did\nnot bellow or kick the ground with his hoofs.

The plowman felt sorry for him and said to himself, “By\nGod, he did seem weak and unable to work.” Then he went to the merchant\nand said, “Master, last night, the ox refused to eat or touch his fodder.”\nThe merchant, who knew what was going on, said to the plowman, “Go\nto the wily donkey, put him to the plow, and work him hard until he finishes\nthe ox’s task.” The plowman left, took the donkey, and placed the yoke upon\nhis neck.

He ate all his food, drank his\nwater, and lay quietly, chewing his cud in comfort. All day long he kept\npraising the donkey’s advice and invoking God’s blessing on him. When the\ndonkey came back at night, the ox stood up to greet him, saying, “Good\nevening, watchful one! You have done me a favor beyond description, for I\nhave been sitting in comfort. God bless you for my sake.” Seething with\nanger, the donkey did not reply, but said to himself, “All this happened to me\nbecause of my miscalculation. ‘I would be sitting pretty, but for my\ncuriosity.’ If I don’t find a way to return this ox to his former situation, I willperish.” Then he we",

I will deliver him, but on two conditions: first,\nthat you let me marry him; second, that you let me cast a spell on her who\nhad cast a spell on him, in order to control her and guard against her evil\npower.” I replied, “Do whatever you wish and more.

We\ntried to dissuade him, but he did not listen. Instead, he bought merchandise\nand trading goods, joined a group of travelers, and was gone for a full year.\nThen he came back, just like his older brother. I said to him, “Brother, didn’t\nI advise you not to go?” He replied tearfully, “Brother, it was foreordained.\nNow I am poor and penniless, without even a shirt on my back.” Demon, I\ntook him to the public bath, clothed him in one of my new robes, and took\nhim back to the shop.

One day there came to the city of King Yunan a sage\ncalled Duban. This sage had read all sorts of books, Greek, Persian, Turkish,\nArabic, Byzantine, Syriac, and Hebrew, had studied the sciences, and had\nlearned their groundwork, as well as their principles and basic benefits. Thus\nhe was versed in all the sciences, from philosophy to the lore of plants and\nherbs, the harmful as well as the beneficial. A few days after he arrived in the\ncity of King Yunan, the sage heard about the king and his leprosy and the fact\nthat the physicians and the sages were unable to cure him.

Your\nMajesty, I can treat you without giving you any medicine to drink or\nointment to apply.” When the king heard this, he said, “If you succeed, I will\nbestow on you riches that would be enough for you and your grandchildren. I\nwill bestow favors on you, and I will make you my companion and friend.”\nThe king bestowed robes of honor on the sage, treated him kindly, and then\nasked him, “Can you really cure me from my leprosy without any medicine\nto drink or ointment to apply?” The sage replied, “Yes, I will cure you\nexternally.” The king was astonished, and he began to feel respect as well as\ngreat affection for the sage. He said, “Now, sage, do what you have\npromised.” The sage replied, “I hear an",

He said to himself,\n“There is no power and no strength, save in God the Almighty, the\nMagnificent.

The\nexecutioner drew his sword and, with one stroke, dropped the head in the\nmiddle of the platter, and when he pressed the head on the powder, the\nbleeding stopped. Then the sage Duban opened his eyes and said, “Now, your\nMajesty, open the book.” When the king opened the book, he found the pages\nstuck. So he put his finger in his mouth, wetted it with his saliva, and opened\nthe first page, and he kept opening the pages with difficulty until he turned\nseven leaves. But when he looked in the book, he found nothing written\ninside, and he exclaimed, “Sage, I see nothing written in this book.” The sage\nreplied, “Open more pages.” The king opened some more pages but still\nfound nothing, and while he was doing this, the",

Then he said to his\nvizier, “Take them to the cook whom the emperor of Byzantium has given us\nas a present.” The vizier took the fish and brought them to the girl and said to\nher, “Girl, as the saying goes, ‘I save my tears for the time of trial.’ The king\nhas been presented these four fish, and he bids you fry them well.” Then the\nvizier went back to report to the king, and the king ordered him to give the\nfisherman four hundred dirhams.\n5\n The vizier gave the money to the\nfisherman, who, receiving it, gathered it in the folds of his robe and went\naway, running, and as he ran, he st",

Then he stopped and bought some provisions\nfor his family.\nSo far for the fisherman, O King. In the meantime the girl scaled the\nfish, cleaned them, and cut them into pieces. Then she placed the frying pan\non the fire and poured in the sesame oil, and when it began to boil, she placed\nthe fish in the frying pan. When the pieces were done on one side, she turned\nthem over, but no sooner had she done this than the kitchen wall split open\nand there emerged a maiden with a beautiful figure, smooth cheeks, perfect\nfeatures, and dark eyes. She wore a short-sleeved silk shirt in the Egyptian\nstyle, embroidered all around with lace and gold spangles. In her ears she\nwore dangling earrings; on her wrists she wore bracelets; an",

In her ears she\nwore dangling earrings; on her wrists she wore bracelets; and in her hand she\nheld a bamboo wand. She thrust the wand into the frying pan and said in clear\nArabic, “O fish, O fish, have you kept the pledge?” When the cook saw what\nhad happened, she fainted. Then the maiden repeated what she had said, and\nthe fish raised their heads from the frying pan and replied in clear Arabic,\n“Yes, yes. If you return, we shall return; if you keep your vow, we shall keep\nours; and if you forsake us, we shall be even.” At that moment the maiden\noverturned the frying pan and disappeared as she had come, and the kitchen\nwall closed behind her.When the cook came to herself, she found the four fish charred, and she\nfelt sorry for herself and afraid of the king, saying to herself, “‘He broke his\nlance on his very first raid.’” While she remonstrated with herself, the ",

When the\nfish were done, the wall split open, and the maiden appeared in her elegant\nclothes, wearing necklaces and other jewelry and holding in her hand the\nbamboo wand. Again she thrust the wand into the frying pan and said in dear\nArabic, “O fish, have you kept the pledge?” and again the fish raised their\nheads and replied, “Yes, yes. If you return, we shall return; if you keep your\nvow, we shall keep ours; and if you forsake us, we shall be even.”\nBut morning overtook Shahrazad, and she lapsed into silence.

Hurry!” Then he assigned three officers to guard the\nfisherman and sent him away. The fisherman disappeared for a while and\nreturned with four fish, one red, one white, one blue, and one yellow. The\nking commanded, “Give him four hundred dirhams,” and the fisherman,\nreceiving the money, gathered it in the folds of his robe and went away. Then\nthe king said to the vizier, “Fry the fish here in my presence.” The vizier\nreplied, “I hear and obey,” and he called for a stove and a frying pan and sat\nto clean the fish.

Then he lit the fire and, pouring the sesame oil, placed the\nfish in the frying pan.\nWhen they were almost done, the palace wall split open, and the king\nand vizier began to tremble, and when they looked up, they saw a black slave\nwho stood like a towering mountain or a giant descendant of the tribe of\n’Ad.\n6\n He was as tall as a reed, as wide as a stone bench, and he held a green\npalm leaf in his hand. Then in clear but unpleasant language, he said, “O fish,\nO fish, have you kept the pledge?” and the fish raised their heads from the\nfrying pan and said, “Yes, yes. If you return, we shall return; if you keep your\nvow, we shall keep ours; and if you forsake us, we shall be even.” At that\nmoment, the black slave overturned the frying pan, in the middle of the hall,\nand the fish turned into charcoal.

Then the black slave departed as he had\ncome, and the wall closed behind him. When the black slave disappeared, the\nking said, “I cannot sleep over this affair, for there is no doubt a mystery\nbehind these fish.” Then he bade the fisherman be brought before him again.\nWhen the fisherman arrived, the king said to him, “Damn you, where do\nyou catch these fish?” The fisherman replied, “My lord, I catch them in a lake\nthat lies among four hills, on the other side of the mountain.” The king turned\nto the vizier and asked, “Do you know this lake?” The vizier replied, “No, byGod, your Majesty. For sixty years, I have hunted, traveled, and roamed far\nand wide, sometimes for a day or two, sometimes for a month or two, but I\nhave never seen or known that such a lake existed on the other side of the\nmountain.” Then the king turned to the fisherman and asked him, “How far ",

Then they climbed the\nmountain, and when they descended to the other side, they saw a vast\nwilderness that they had never seen in all their lives, as well as the four hills\nand the lake in whose clear water they saw the fish in four colors, red, white,\nblue, and yellow. The king stood marveling; then he turned to the vizier,\nprinces, chamberlains, and deputies and asked, “Have any of you ever seen\nthis lake before?” They replied, “Never.” He asked, “And none of you ",

By God, I shall not return to the city until I find the\nanswer to the mystery behind this lake and these fish in four colors.” Then he\nordered his men to halt and pitch the tents, and he dismounted and waited.\nWhen it was dark, he summoned the vizier, who was an experienced and\nwise man of the world. The vizier came to the king, without being seen by the\nsoldiers, and when he arrived, the king said, “I wish to reveal to you what I\nintend to do.

You must not let anyone know about my departure and absence,\nand you must wait for me for three days.” The vizier, unable to disobey him,\nabided by the order, saying, “I hear and obey.”\nThen the king packed, prepared himself, and girded himself with the\nroyal sword. Then he climbed one of the four hills, and when he reached the\ntop, he journeyed on for the rest of the night.

It had double doors, one open, one shut. Pleased, the king knocked\ngently at the door and waited patiently for a while without hearing any reply.\nHe knocked again, this time more loudly than before, but again waited\nwithout hearing any reply or seeing anyone. He knocked for the third time\nand kept knocking repeatedly but once more waited without hearing any\nreply or seeing anyone.

Feeling bold and determined, he advanced from the hallway into the\ncenter of the palace and looked around, but saw no one.\nBut morning overtook Shahrazad, and she lapsed into silence.

The palace was furnished with silk carpets\nand leather mats and hung with drapes. There were also settees, benches, and\nseats with cushions, as well as cupboards. In the middle there stood a\nspacious courtyard, surrounded by four adjoining recessed courts facing each\nother. In the center stood a fountain, on top of which crouched four lions inred gold, spouting water from their mouths in droplets that looked like gems\nand pearls, and about the fountain singing birds fluttered under a high net to\nprevent them from flying away.

Then, my lord, she moved the wounded black man to the mausoleum\nand placed him in the tomb. But, although he was still alive, from the day I\ncut his throat, he never spoke a word or was able to do her any good, except\nto drink liquids. She visited him in the mausoleum every day, morning and\nevening, bringing with her beverages and broth, and she kept at it for an\nentire year, while I held my patience and left her to her own devices.

Alas, alas, what is done cannot be\nundone; nor will the dead come back to life, but God has delivered into my\nhand the one who did this to me and set my heart ablaze with the fire of\nrevenge.” Then she stood up, uttered words I could not understand, and cried,\n“With my m",

Likewise,\nshe turned the islands into four hills surrounding the lake.

For as a table needs four\nlegs to stand on, you being three, likewise need a fourth, for the pleasure of\nmen is not complete without women, and the pleasure of women is not\ncomplete without men. The poet says:\nFor our delight four things we need, the lute,\nThe harp, the zither, and the double flute,\nBlending with the scent of four lovely flowers,\nRoses, myrtles, anemones, and gillyflowers.\nOnly in four such things join together,\nMoney, and wine, and youth, and a lover.\nYou are three and you need a fourth, a man.” His words pleased the girls,\nwho laughed and said, “How can we manage that, being girls who keep our\nbusiness to ourselves, for we fear to entrust our secrets where they may not\nbe kept.

I have studied the sciences and attained knowledge; I\nhave read and learned, and presented my knowledge and cited my authorities.\nI reveal the good and conceal the bad, and I am well-behaved.

When I shot at the bird, the missile\nmissed him and instead hit the vizier and pierced the corner of his eye, and\nthat was the cause of his grudge against me; therefore, when they brought me\nbefore him, he thrust his finger into my eye, gouged it out, and made it ooze\nover my cheek. Then he bound me, placed me in a chest, and handed me over\nto my father’s swordsman, saying, “Ride your horse, draw your sword, and\ntake this one with you into the wilderness. Then kill him and let the beasts\nand vultures devour his flesh.” The executioner followed the vizier’s order\nand led me into the wilderness. ",
    "our sword, and\ntake this one with you into the wilderness. Then kill him and let the beasts\nand vultures devour his flesh.” The executioner followed the vizier’s order\nand led me into the wilderness. Then he dismounted, taking me out of the\nchest, and looked at me and was about to kill me. I wept bitterly over what\nhad happened to me until I made him weep with me. Then looking at him, I\nbegan to recite the following verses:\nMy shield I deemed you from the foeman’s dart,\nBut you did prove to be that very dart.\nI counted on your aid in all mishaps,\nJust as the left hand comes to aid the right.\nStand then as one absolved, away from me,\nAnd let the foes at me their arrows aim,\nFor if our friendship you cannot maintain,\nBetween yourself and me there is no claim.\nWhen the executioner heard my verses, he felt pity for me, and he\nspared me and set me free, saying, “Run with your life and never return to\nthis land, for they will kill you and kill me with you.” The poet says:\nIf you suffer injus",
    "rses, he felt pity for me, and he\nspared me and set me free, saying, “Run with your life and never return to\nthis land, for they will kill you and kill me with you.” The poet says:\nIf you suffer injustice, save yourself,\nAnd leave the house behind to mourn its builder.\nYour country you’ll replace by another,\nBut for yourself, you’ll find no other self.Nor with a mission trust another man,\nFor none is as loyal as you yourself.\nAnd did the lion not struggle by himself,\nHe would not prowl with such a mighty mane.\nHardly believing in my escape, I kissed his hand and thought that losing my\neye was certainly better than dying.\nThen I journeyed slowly until I reached my uncle’s city. When I went to\nhim and told him about my father’s death and the loss of my eye, he said to\nme, “I too have enough woes, for my son is missing, and I do not know what\nhas happened to him, nor do I have any news about him.” Then he wept\nbitterly, reviving my old grief and arousing my pity.

    "woes, for my son is missing, and I do not know what\nhas happened to him, nor do I have any news about him.” Then he wept\nbitterly, reviving my old grief and arousing my pity. Unable to remain silent,\nI acquainted him with what his son had done, and he was exceedingly happy\nand said, “Come and show me the sepulcher.” I replied, “By God, uncle, I\nhave lost the way to it, and I no longer know which one it is.” He said, “Let\nus go together.” Then he and I went secretly to the graveyard, and when I\ncame to the center, I suddenly recognized the sepulcher and was exceedingly\nhappy at the prospect of finding out what lay below the staircase and what\nhad happened to my cousin. We entered the sepulcher, opened the tomb, and,\nremoving the earth, found the iron plate. My uncle led the way, and we\ndescended about fifty steps, and as we reached the bottom of the staircase, we\nmet a great cloud of smoke that almost blinded our eyes.

We wandered\nabout and saw a cistern in the center, saw large jars and sacks full of flour,\ngrains, and the like, and at the end of the hall saw a bed covered with a\ncanopy. My uncle went up to the bed, and when he lifted the curtain, he\nfound his son and the lady who had gone down with him, lying in each\nother’s arms, but saw that the two had turned to black charcoal. It was as if\nthey had been cast into a raging fire, which burned them thoroughly until\nthey were reduced to charcoal.

He had tortured the girl almost to her death, but she did not confess.\nSo he took the axe and the sandals, saying, “If I am truly the son of Satan’s\ndaughter, I shall bring you back the owner of the axe.” Then he assumed the\nguise of a Persian gentleman and came to find me.

But the envied did nothing but prosper, and the more the envious\nstrove to injure him, the more he throve and flourished. At last the envy and\nmalice of his neighbor came to his attention, and he left the neighborhood\nand moved to another city, saying, “By God, because of him, I will even\ndepart from this world.” There he bought himself a piece of land that had an\nold irrigation well, built a hermitage that he furnished with straw mats and\nother necessities, and devoted himself to the worship of the Almighty God.\nThe mendicants began to flock to him from every quarter, and his fame\nspread throughout the city.\nSoon the news reached his",

Then\nthe envious said; “I would like to acquaint you with something that has\ncaused me to come to you.

He dismounted with the lords of the realm, bidding the rest of histroops stand outside. When he entered the hermitage, the envied welcomed\nhim and, seating him by his side, asked, “Shall I tell you the cause of your\nvisit?” The king replied, “Yes.” The envied continued: “You have come to\nvisit me with the intention of consulting me about your daughter.” The king\nsaid, “O man of God, you’re right.” The envied said, “Send someone to fetch\nher, and God the Almighty willing, she will recover presently.” The king\ngladly sent for his daughter, and they",

The king said, “Give him one thousand weights of gold from my\ntreasury, provide him with twenty loads of goods he trades in, and send him\nwith an escort to his own town.” Then the envied bade him farewell and went\naway without reproaching him for what he had done to him.\nI said to the demon, “O demon, consider the mercy of the envied on the\nenvious, who had envied him from the beginning, borne him great malice,\npursued him, followed him, and thrown him into the well to ki",

Then I descended the mountain and found a vast desert, over\nwhich I journeyed for a month until I reached the seashore.

When the merchants saw me, they said to the captain,\n“You have risked our lives and property for an ape, who brings bad luck with\nhim wherever he goes.” One of them said, “Let me kill him.” Another said,\n“Let me shoot him with an arrow.” And a third said, “Let us drown him.”\nWhen I heard what they said, I sprang up and held the hem of the captain’s\ngown like a suppliant, as my tears began to flow over my face. The captain\nand all the merchants were amazed, and some of them began to feel pity for\nme.

No sooner had we entered\nthe port and cast anchor than we were visited by messengers from the king of\nthat city.

Everyone came out, crowding to gaze at me and enjoy\nthe spectacle. By the time I reached the king, the whole city was astir, and the\npeople were saying to each other, “The king has taken an ape for vizier.”\nWhen I entered into the presence of the king, I prostrated myself and\nthen stood up and bowed three times.

A\nsecond spark hit the king, burning half of his face, including his beard and\nchin, and knocking out a row of his teeth. A third spark hit the servant in the\nchest and killed him instantly. At that moment, as we felt certain of\ndestruction and gave ourselves up for lost, we heard a cry, “God is great, God\nis great! He has conquered and triumphed; He has defeated the infidel.” It\nwas the cry of the king’s daughter, who had at that very moment defeated the\ndemon. We looked and saw a heap of ashes.\nThen the girl came up to us and said, “Bring me a bowl of water,” and\ncrying, “In the name of the Almighty God and His covenant, be yourself\nagain,” she sprinkled me with the water, and I shook and stood “a full-\nfledged man.” Then she cried ou",

I\nleft the king’s capital in dismay and tears, not knowing where I should go,\nand when I recalled everything that had happened to me, how I had entered\nthe city and in what condition I was leaving it, my grief grew worse.

Having patiently cleared the earth away, I\nuncovered a single millstone, and when I lifted it up, I was surprised to find a\nwinding stone staircase. I descended the steps, and when I came to the end, I\nfound myself in a clean, whitewashed hall, spread with various kinds of\ncarpets, beddings, and silk stuffs. There I saw the young man sitting on a high\ncouch, leaning back on a round cushion, with a fan in his hand. A banquet\nwas set before him, with fruits, flowers, and scented herbs, as he sat there all\nalone.

Then\nhe made me draw near to him and said, “O my brother, my case is strange\nand my tale is amazing. My father is a very wealthy jeweler, who deals even\nwith kings and who has many black and white slaves as well as traders who\ntravel on ships to trade for him. But he was not blessed with a child. One\nnight he dreamt that he was going to have a son who would be short-lived,\nand he woke up in the morning, feeling depressed. My mother happened to\nconceive on the following night, and my father noted the date of her\nconception.

For there stands in the salty sea a mountain called the\nmagnetic mountain, on top of which stands a brass horseman riding on a\nbrass horse and holding in his mouth a lead tablet. Fifty days after this\nhorseman falls from the horse, your son will die, and his killer will be the\nman who will have thrown the horseman off the horse, a man named ’Ajib,\nson of King Khasib.’ My father was stricken with grief. But he raised me and\neducated me as the years went by until I was fifteen.

When my father heard the news,\nhe wept bitterly at our impending separation and became like a madman.\nThen for fear that ’Ajib, son of King Khasib, would kill me, my father built\nme this house under the ground and brought me in the ship with everything I\nneed for the duration of fifty days. Ten days have already passed, and there\nremain only forty days until the conjunction of the stars is over and my father\ncomes back to take me home. This is my story and the cause of my loneliness\nand isolation.”My lady, when I heard his narrative and strange tale, I said to myself, “I\nam the one who overthrew the brass horseman, and I am ’Ajib, son of King\nKhasib, but by God, I will never kill him.” Then I said to him, “O my lord,\nmay you be spared from death and safe from harm.

I will help you and go home with you, and you in turn\nwill help me to return to my native land, and God will reward you.” My\nwords pleased him, and I sat to chat with him and entertain him.\nWhen night came, I got up and, lighting a candle, I filled and lit three oil\nlamps. Then I offered him a box of sweets, and after we both ate and savored\nsome, we sat and chatted most of the night. When he fell asleep, I covered\nhim, and then I too lay down and slept. When I woke up in the morning, I\nheated some water for him and gently woke him up, and when he awoke, I\nbrought him the hot water, and he washed his face and thanked me saying,\n“God bless you, young man.

We diverted and\namused ourselves, playing and eating and drinking till nightfall. Then I rose,\nlit the lamps, and offered him some sweets, and after we ate and savored\nsome, we sat and chatted, then went to sleep.\nMy lady, in this way we passed many days and nights, and I became an\nintimate friend of his, felt a great affection for him, and forgot my cares and\nsorrows.

On the night of\nthe fortieth day, feeling glad at his safe escape, he said, “Brother, I have now\ncompleted forty days. Praise be to God who has saved me from death by your\nblessed coming. By God, I shall make my father reward you and send you to\nyour native land. But, brother, kindly heat some water for me, so that I may\nwash my body and change my clothes.” I replied, “With the greatest\npleasure.” Then I rose, heated some water, and took the young man into alittle room where I gave him a good bath and put on him fresh clothes.

When I saw that he was dead and realized that\nit was I who had killed him, I let out a loud scream, beat my face, tore my\nclothes, and cried, “O people, O God’s creatures, there remained for this\nyoung man only one day out of the forty, yet he still met his death",

When they\nsaw me, they greeted me, delighted to see me, and when they asked me about\nmyself, I told them about my misfortunes. Marveling at my tale, they took me\ninto the palace, where I saw ranged around the hall ten couches, each with\nblue bedding and blue coverlet, with a smaller couch in the middle, covered\nlikewise in blue.

At\nlast I said to them, “Young men, if you don’t relieve me and tell me why you\nblacken your faces and repeat, ‘We would be sitting pretty but for our\ncuriosity,’ let me relieve myself of such sights by leaving you and going\nhome, for as the saying goes, ‘Better for me and meet to see you not, for if\nthe eye sees nought, the heart grieves not.’” When they heard my words, they\ncame up to me and said, “Young man, we have kept our secret from you only\nout of pity for you, so that you would not suffer what we have su",

I\nopened the door and, entering the chamber, greeted him and said, “Blessed be\nGod who has granted you to me, to be the cause of our deliverance and help\nour ship return to our native land. O holy man, by the Holy Book you are\nreciting, answer my question.” He looked at me with a smile and said, “O\ngood woman, tell me first what caused you to come here, and I shall relate to\nyou what happened to me and to the people of this city and why they were\ncursed while I was not.” I told him our story and how our ship had strayed for\ntwenty days.

Here I sit now, as you see, to worship God, but I\nhave grown weary of loneliness, for there is none to keep me company.”\nI said to him (for he had captured my heart and mastered my life and\nsoul), “Come with me to the city of Baghdad, for this girl standing before you\nis the head of her family, mistress over servants and slaves, and a\nbusinesswoman of considerable wealth, part of which is on the very ship that,\nafter straying, now anchors outside your city, by the will of God who drove\nus here that I might meet you.” I continued to press him, O Commander of\nthe Faithful, until he consented.

When they saw me, they were\nhappy, and when I related to them the story of the young man and the city,\nthey were amazed. But when my two sisters, these very bitches, saw the\nyoung man with me, they envied me, O Commander of the Faithful, and\nharbored ill feelings toward me.

We\nsailed on under a fair wind until we entered the Sea of Safety and began to\napproach Basra. When night came, and the young man and I fell asleep, my\ntwo sisters, who had been waiting patiently, carried me with my bed and\nthrew me into the sea. They did the same thing to the young man.

I crossed it; then I wrung out my clothes and spread them to dry inthe sun. When they were dry, I ate some dates and drank some fresh water I\nhad found there; then I proceeded to walk until there remained only two\nhours between me and the city. As I sat to rest, I suddenly saw a long serpent,\nas thick as the trunk of a palm tree, gliding sideways and sweeping the sand\nin her way, as she speeded toward me. When she drew near, I saw that she\nwas being pursued by a long and slender serpent, as slender as a spear and as\nlong as two.

He had seized her by the tail, while she, with a tongue about ten\ninches long, rolling in the dust, and eyes streaming with tears, wriggled right\nand left, trying to escape. Feeling pity for her, O Commander of the Faithful,\nI ran toward a big stone, picked it up, and calling on God for help, hit him\nwith it and killed him. As soon as he rolled dead, the serpent opened a pair of\nwings, flew up, and disappeared from my sight.\nThen I sat down to rest and dozed off, and when I awoke, I saw a black\ngirl, together with two bitches, sitting at my feet, massaging them. Sitting up,\nI asked, “O friend, who are you?” She replied, “How soon you have forgotten\nme. I am she for whom you have done the good deed and sowed the seed of\ngratitude.

    "\nWhen my father died, he left me a great deal of money. Shortly thereafter, I\nmarried the wealthiest man in Baghdad, and for a year I lived with him the\nhappiest of lives. Then he too died and left me my legal share of the\ninheritance, which was ninety thousand dinars. I lived a prosperous life,\nbuying so much gold jewelry, clothes, and embroideries that I had ten\ncomplete changes of clothes, each costing one thousand dinars, and my\nreputation spread in the city. One day, as I was sitting at home, an old woman\ncame to me, and what an old woman she was, with a pallid, scabby skin; a\nbent body; matted gray hair; a gray, freckled face; broken teeth; plucked-out\neyebrows; hollow, bleary eyes; and a runny nose. She was like the one of\nwhom the poet said:\nSeven defects are planted in her face,\nThe least of which is but the curse of fate\nA bleary frown that covers all the face,\nA mouth full of stones, or a mowed-down pate.\nShe greeted me and, kissing the ground before me, said, “My lady, I\nha",

If you come to her wedding, you will earn a reward in Heaven, for\nwhen the ladies of this city will hear that you are coming, they too will come,\nand you shall honor us with your presence and make her happy.” Then the\nold woman repeated the following verses:\nWe own that your visit is an honor\nThat cannot be performed by another.\nShe wept and implored me until I felt pity for her and agreed to her\nrequest. I said, “Yes, I shall do it for the sake of the Almighty God, and she\nwill not be unveiled to her bridegroom, save in my clothes, ornaments, and\njewelry.” Overjoyed, the old woman bent and kissed my feet, saying, “May\nGod reward you",

Be ready at suppertime, and I shall come and fetchyou.” When she left, I proceeded to string the pearls, assemble the\nembroideries, and pack the ornaments and jewelry, not knowing what God\nhad in store for me. At nightfall the old woman arrived with a happy smile\nand, kissing my hand, said, “Most of the ladies of the city are already\nassembled in our house, and they are waiting for you and looking forward to\nyour coming.” I rose, put on my outer garment, and, wrapping myself in my\ncloak, followed the old lady with my maids behind me.

Suddenly, O Commander of the\nFaithful, a girl came out from behind the curtain, shining like the half moon.\nIndeed, her face was as radiant as the full moon or the rising sun, just like her\nof whom the poet said:\nTo her inferior Caesar she was sent,\nA gift nobler than all her Persian k",

He was sweetly\ncoquettish, with a fine figure, eyebrows arching like a bow, and eyes that\nbewitched the heart with their holy magic. He was like him of whom the poet\nsaid:\nHe has a face as bright as the young moon,\nAnd joys as pearls he scatters as a boon.\nAs soon as I looked at him, I was attracted to him.

Then the young man made me pledge that I\nwould not look at any other man, and he was not satisfied until I took a\nsolemn oath. I was feeling very happy and impatient for the night to come.\nWhen it finally came, we retired to our room, and I spent with him the best of\nnights. In the morning he slaughtered many sheep in thanksgiving, showedme favors, and treated me lovingly. For a full month thereafter, I lived with\nhim a most happy life.\nOne day, wishing to buy certain fabric, I asked him for permission to go\nto the market.

He put his mouth on\nmy cheek and bit off with his teeth a piece of my flesh. I fainted, and when I\ncame to myself, a long time later, I saw that he had locked the shop and\ndeparted, while the old woman, in a display of grief, sorrowed over my\nbleeding face.\nBut morning overtook Shahrazad, and she lapsed into silence.\nT\nHE \nS\nIXTY-\nE\nIGHTH \nN\nIGHTThe following night Shahrazad said:\nI have heard, O happy King, that the flogged girl said to the Commander\nof the Faithful:\nThe old woman",

At that moment, O Commander of the Faithful, he cried\nout and a door opened and out came three black slaves who, at his bidding,\ndragged me out of my bed and threw me down on my back in the middle of\nthe room.

Knowing\nwhat her sisters had done to her, I felt bound to reward her by avenging her.\nAt first, I was about to destroy them once and for all, but I feared that their\ndeaths would be hard on her; therefore, I cast a spell on them and turned them\ninto bitches. Now, if you wish me to release them, O Commander of the\nFaithful, I will do it gladly, for your wish is my command, O Commander of\nthe Faithful!” The caliph replied, “O spirit, release them and let us deliver\nthem from their misery.

In fact, he is the nearest of all men to\nyou.” Then she took, O King, a bowl of water, and muttering a spell over it in\nwords no one could understand, sprinkled the two sisters with the water and\nturned them back into their original form.\nThen the she-demon said, “O Commander of the Faithful, the man who\nbeat this girl is your son al-Amin brother of al-Ma’mun. He had heard of her\nbeauty and charm, and he tricked her into a legal marriage.

We\nlived together for eleven years, during which time God blessed her and she\nbore me three sons. She was well-behaved toward me and served me\nexceedingly well, and I in turn loved her very much. On the first day of this\nmonth she fell gravely ill and kept getting worse, but I took great care of her\nuntil by the end of the month she slowly began to recover.\nOne day, before going to the bath, she said to me, “Husband, I want you\nto satisfy a desire of mine.” I replied, “I hear and obey, even if it were a\nthousand desires.” She said, “I have a craving for an apple.

If I could only\nsmell it and take a bite, I wouldn’t care if I die afterward.” I replied, “It shall\nbe done.” Then I went and looked for apples but could not find any anywhere\nin your whole city. Had I found any, I would have paid a dinar for one.\nVexed at my failure to satisfy her craving, I went home and said, “Wife, I\nwas unable to find any apples.” She was upset and, being still ill, suffered a\nrelapse that night. As soon as it was morning, I went out and made the rounds\nof the orchards, one by one, but found no apples anywhere. At last a very old\ngardener answered my inquiry, saying, “Son, no apples can be found, except\nin the orchards of the Commander of the Faithful in Basra, where they are\nstored by the gardener.

But when I handed them to\nher, she showed no pleasure in them but laid them aside. Then she suffered\nanother relapse, lay ill, and made me worried about her for ten days.\nOne day, as I sat in my shop, buying and selling fabrics, I suddenly saw\nan ugly black slave, as tall as a reed and as broad as a bench, passing by. Hewas holding in his hand one of the three apples for which I had journeyed for\nhalf a month. I called after him, saying, “My good slave, where did you get\nthis apple?” He replied, “I got it from my mistress, for I went to see her today\nand found her lying ill with three apples by her side.

She told me that her\npimp of a husband had journeyed for half a month to bring them. After I ate\nand drank with her, I took one of the apples with me.” When I heard what he\nsaid, O Commander of the Faithful, the world turned black before my eyes. I\nlocked up my shop and went home, mad with resentment and fury. When I\ngot home and looked for the apples, I found only two, and when I asked her,\n“Wife, where is the other apple?” she raised her head and replied, “By God,\nhusband, I don’t know.” This convinced me that the slave had told the truth,\nand I took a sharp knife and, stealing behind her silently, knelt on her breast,\nworked the knife into her throat, and cut off her head. Then I quickly placed\nher in a basket, covered her with a woman’s cloak, placed a piece of carpet\non top of it, and sewed the basket. Then I placed the basket inside a chest,\ncarri",

For God’s sake, O\nCommander of the Faithful, avenge her on me and hang me quickly, or I will\ncall you to account on her behalf before the Almighty God.

Scared\nof my mother, I went with my brothers outside the city and we stayed there in\nfear until it started to get dark. For God’s sake, father, say nothing to her of\nthis, or her illness will get worse.” When I heard my son’s words and saw\nhim trembling and weeping, O Commander of the Faithful, I realized that I\nhad killed my wife wrongfully and that she had died unjustly; the accursed\nslave, hearing about the apples from my son, had slandered her and lied about\nher.

Then he asked Ja’far, “Do you mean to tell\nme that this slave of yours is the cause of all the trouble?” Ja’far replied,\n“Yes, Commander of the Faithful.” Seeing that the caliph was greatly struck\nby the coincidences of the story, Ja’far said to the Commander of the\nFaithful, “Do not marvel at this story, for it is not as ",

If it is indeed more amazing than the events we have just witnessed, I will\npardon your slave, but if it is not, I will kill him.

    "the two great rivers that cross Iraq from north to south, the other being the Euphrates.[The Story of the Two Viziers, Nur al-Din Ali al-Misri and Badr al-Din\nHasan al-Basri]\n4\nI HEARD, O Commander of the Faithful, that a long time ago there lived in\nthe province of Egypt a just, trusted, kind, generous, courageous, and\npowerful king, who associated with the learned and loved the poor. He had a\nwise, experienced, and influential vizier who was careful, cautious, and\nskilled in the affairs of state. This vizier, who was a very old man, had two\nsons who were like two moons or two lovely deer in their perfect elegance,\nbeauty, and grace. The elder was called Shams al-Din Muhammad, the\nyounger, Nur al-Din Ali. The younger surpassed his brother in beauty; indeed\nin his day God had created none more beautiful. One day as it had been\nforeordained, their father the vizier died, and the king mourned him and\nsummoned the two sons, bestowed on them robes of honor and other favors\nand said, “You s",
    "more beautiful. One day as it had been\nforeordained, their father the vizier died, and the king mourned him and\nsummoned the two sons, bestowed on them robes of honor and other favors\nand said, “You shall take your father’s place and be joint viziers of Egypt.”\nThey kissed the ground before him and withdrew and for a full month they\nperformed the ceremonial mourning for their father. Then they assumed their\nposition, taking turns, each performing his duty for a week at a time, and each\naccompanying the king on one journey at a time. The two lived in the same\nhouse and their word was one.\nIt happened that one night, before the elder brother was to set out on a\njourney with the king the next morning, the two brothers sat chatting. The\nelder brother said, “Brother, I wish that you and I would marry two sisters,\ndraw our marriage contracts on the same day, and go in to our wives on the\nsame night.” Nur al-Din replied, “Brother, do as you wish, for this is an\nexcellent idea, but let us wait",
    " marry two sisters,\ndraw our marriage contracts on the same day, and go in to our wives on the\nsame night.” Nur al-Din replied, “Brother, do as you wish, for this is an\nexcellent idea, but let us wait until you come back from your journey, and\nwith God’s blessing we shall seek two girls in marriage.” The elder brother\nsaid to Nur al-Din, “Tell me, brother, if you and I perform our wedding on\nthe same day and consummate our marriage on the same night and if your\nwife and mine conceive on our wedding night and at the end of their\npregnancy give birth on the same day and if your wife gives birth to a boy\nand my wife to a girl, tell me, will you marry your son to my daughter?” Nur\nal-Din replied, “Yes, brother Shams al-Din,” adding, “But what dowry will\nyou require from my son for your daughter?” The elder brother replied, “I\nwill take at least three thousand dinars, three orchards, and three farms inaddition to an amount specified in the contract.” Nur al-Din replied, “Brother\nShams al-Di",
    "r?” The elder brother replied, “I\nwill take at least three thousand dinars, three orchards, and three farms inaddition to an amount specified in the contract.” Nur al-Din replied, “Brother\nShams al-Din, why such an excessive dowry? Are we not brothers, and is not\neach of us a vizier who knows his obligations? It behooves you to offer your\ndaughter to my son without a dowry, for the male is worthier than the female.\nBut you treat me like the man who said to another who came to ask for help\n‘Very well, I will help you, but wait till tomorrow,’ prompting the other to\nrepeat the following verses:\nWhen one postpones the favor for a day,\nThe wise man knows that he has answered, ‘Nay.’”\nShams al-Din said, “Enough of your comments. Damn you for comparing\nyour son to my daughter and thinking that he is worthier than she; by God,\nyou lack understanding and wisdom. You say that we are partners in the\nvizierate, without realizing that I let you share it with me, only in order to\nspare your feeling",
    "e is worthier than she; by God,\nyou lack understanding and wisdom. You say that we are partners in the\nvizierate, without realizing that I let you share it with me, only in order to\nspare your feelings by letting you assist me. By God, I will never marry my\ndaughter to your son, not even for her weight in gold. I will never marry her\nto your son and have him for a son-in-law, not even if I have to suffer death.”\nWhen Nur al-Din heard his brother’s words, he became very angry and\nasked, “Will you indeed not marry your daughter to my son?” Shams al-Din\nreplied, “No, I will never consent to that, for he is not worth even a paring of\nher nail. Were I not on the eve of a journey, I would make an example of you,\nbut when I come back, I will show you how I will vindicate my honor.” Nur\nal-Din’s anger grew so great that he was beside himself with rage, but he hid\nwhat he felt, while the brother sulked, and the two spent the night far apart,\neach full of wrath against the other.\nAs soon as it w",

When Shams\nal-Din departed, Nur al-Din got up, still full of anger, opened his treasure\nchamber and, taking gold only, filled a small saddlebag. He recalled how his\nbrother had scolded him and insulted him, and he recited the following\nverses:\nTravel, and new friends will succeed the friends you lost,\nAnd toil, for life’s sweets do through toil come.To stay wins you no honor nor from exile saves;\nSet out to roam the world and leave your home.\nWhen water stands, it stagnant turns and stinks\nBut tastes so sweet when it does flow and run.\nAnd if the sun stood in its orbit still,\nBoth Arabs and barbarians would tire of the sun,\nAnd if the full moon did not wane and set,\nNo watch",

She was\na particularly fine riding animal, with dappled gray skin, ears like sharp reed\npens, and legs like pillars. He ordered the page to saddle her with all her\ntrappings, to place the saddlebags on her back, and to cover them with a soft\nseat of silk carpeting. Then he said to his pages and slaves, “I am leaving the\ncity on an excursion in the vici",

Then he said to his pages and slaves, “I am leaving the\ncity on an excursion in the vicinity of Qalyubiya to divert myself for a night\nor two, for I have been very depressed lately. Let none of you follow me.”\nThen he took some provisions, mounted the she-mule, and leaving Cairo,\n5\nentered the desert. At midday, he reached a town called Bilbis, where he\ndismounted to rest and have something to eat. Then he took some food for\nhimself and forage for his she-mule and left the town and, spurring his she-\nmule, fared forth in the desert. By nightfall, he reached the town of al-\nSa’idiya, where he dismounted to spend the night at the post station. He\nwalked the she-mule seven or eight times, then gave her some fodder to eat,and after he himself ate some food, he spread the carpet he had used for a seat\nand, placing the saddlebags under his head, lay down, still seething with\nanger,",

Nur al-Din Ali told\nthe vizier about himself and said, “I quarreled with my family and pledged\nmyself not to go back until I visit all the countries of the world, even if",

Nur al-Din Ali told\nthe vizier about himself and said, “I quarreled with my family and pledged\nmyself not to go back until I visit all the countries of the world, even if I\nperish and meet my end before I achieve my aim.” When the vizier of Basra\nheard his words, he said to him, “O my son, do not go any further, for most of\nthe regions are waste, and I fear for your safety. “Then he took Nur al-Din\nAli home with him and treated him with kindness and generosity, for he was\nbeginning to feel a great affection for him. Then the vizier said to him, “O my\nson, I am a very old man whom God has never blessed with a son, but I have\na daughter who is your equal in beauty. Many wealthy and eminent men have\nasked for her hand, but I have rejected them all, but since I have affection for\nyou, will you accept my daughter as your wife and maid and be a husband to\nher?

For by God, son, I am advanced in\nyears and I am weary and worn out. You shall be a son to me and shall have\ncontrol over my possessions and over the vizierate in the province of Basra.”\nWhen Nur al-Din heard the vizier’s words, he bowed his head a while, then\nfinally looked up and said, “I hear and obey.” The vizier was overjoyed, and\nhe bade his servants prepare food and sweets and decorate the large hall used\nfor wedding feasts, and they at once did as he bade. Then he gathered his\nfriends and invited the prominent and the wealthy men of Basra, and when\nthey were all assembled, he said, “I have a brother who is the vizier of Egypt.\nHe has been blessed with a son and I, as you know, have been bless",

After the wedding, I shall prepare him\nfor the journey and send him back with his wife.” They replied, “This is an\nexcellent idea and a happy and praiseworthy plan. May God crown your good\nfortune with happiness and may He keep your course blameless.”\nBut morning overtook Shahrazad, and she lapsed into silence.\nT\nHE \nS\nEVENTY-\nT\nHIRD \nN\nIGHT\nThe following night Shahrazad said:\nI heard, O happy King, that Ja’far said to the caliph:\nThe prominent men of Basra said, “May God keep your course\nblameless.” Then the witnesses arrived, and the servants brought the tables\nand laid out the banquet, and t",

Then the servants\ncleared the tables, and the witnesses came forward and signed the marriage\ncontract, and when the incense rose, the guests departed.\nThen the vizier ordered his servants to take Nur al-Din Ali al-Misri to\nthe bath and sent him a full attire worthy of a king, as well as towels, incense,\nand whatever he needed. A little later, Nur al-Din came back from the bath,\nlooking like the full moon or the rising sun, like him of whom the poet said:\nThe scent is musk, the cheek a rose,\nThe teeth are pearls, the mouth is wine,\nThe frame a bough, the hip a barge,\nThe hair is night, the face a moon divine.\nHe went in to his father-in-law and kissed his hand, and the vizier stood up to\ngree",

Then turning\nto him, he asked, “Son, I would like you to tell me why you left your family,\nand how it is that they allowed you to depart. Hide nothing from me and tell\nme the truth, for it is said:Be truthful, even though the truth\nMay torment you with hellish fire,\nAnd please the Lord and not his slaves,\nIn order to avoid His ire.\nI wish to take you to the king and let you have my position.” When Nur al-\nDin heard what his father-in-law said, he replied, “O great Vizier and mighty\nlord, I am not of humble origin, nor did I leave my family with their consent.\nMy father was a vizier.” And he told him about what happened after his\nfather died and about the dispute between himself and his brother (but there is\nno point in repeating t",

This is my story.” When the\nvizier heard Nur al-Din’s story, he was amazed and said with a smile, “My\nson, you quarreled even before getting married and having children! Now,\nson, go in to your wife, and tomorrow I shall take you to the king and\nacquaint him with our case, and I hope that God will grant you every\nblessing.”\nIt so chanced, as God had willed and ordained, that on the very same\nnight on which Nur al-Din consummated his marriage in Basra, his brother\nShams al-Din Muhammad consummated his own marriage to a girl in Egypt.\nThis is how it came about.\nIt is related that Ja’far said to the caliph:\nI heard that at the time Nur al-Din set out from Egypt, his elder brother\nShams al-Din jou",

I went\ntoo far in quarreling with him over the marriage.”\nSome time later, the Almighty God willed that Shams al-Din should\nseek in marriage the daughter of one of the merchants of Cairo, that he should\ndraw up the marriage contract on the very same day that his brother drew up\nhis in Basra and that he should consummate his marriage on the very same\nnight that his brother consummated his own with the vizier’s daughter in\nBasra.

She was riding a she-mule, with one black slave\nwalking before and another behind her. She dismounted and, leaving the she-\nmule by the entrance, entered the market. No sooner had she done so, when a\nwell-groomed eunuch followed her and said, “My lady, go in, but don’t let\nanyone recognize you, or we will be in trouble.” Then he stood guard before\nher, while she looked at the shops and, finding none open but mine, came up\nto my shop, followed by the eunuch, greeted me, and sat down.\nBut morning overtook Shahrazad, and she lapsed into silence.

Meanwhile he kept a\nconstant watch on the old woman, while she took one man after another and\nled them to that house. But my brother said nothing. When he regained his\nhealth and recovered his strength, he took a piece of cloth and made it into a\nbag, which he filled with glass.But morning overtook Shahrazad, and she lapsed into silence.

When he saw the old woman, he said to her, with a Persian\naccent, “Old lady, I am a stranger here. Do you have a pair of scales large\nenough to weigh five hundred dinars? I will give you some of it for your\ntrouble.” The old woman replied, “O Persian, my son is a money changer,\nand he has all kinds of scales.

He promised to spare her and asked, “And\nyou, how did you come to be with this black slave?” She replied, “I was a\nslave to a merchant, and the old woman used to visit me until we became\nintimate friends.

He stood for a while, perplexed, not\nknowing where to go; then he proceeded toward the door of a reception\nroom, and when he entered, he saw at the upper end a handsome man with a\nfine beard.

He was truthful, well-mannered, friendly, and well-liked everywhere.\nHe used to enter the caliph’s palace, for most of the caliph’s women and\nconcubines used to go to him to fill their needs. He was also patronized by\nthe sons of princes and notable men, one of whom was a descendant of the\nkings of Persia, a young man named Nur al-Din Ali ibn-Bakkar.

This young\nman was endowed by God with every virtue, perfect beauty and grace,\neloquence and sweetness of tongue, wisdom and nobility, generosity and\nmodesty, manliness and chivalry. He was so much attached to Abu al-Hasan\nibn-Tahir that he could not bear to leave him even for a moment.\nIt chanced one day that as he sat with Abu al-Hasan in his shop there\ncame up ten full-bosomed virgins, looking like moons, with a young lady\nriding on a gray she-mule with trappings of red silk set with gems and pearls.\nHer beauty, which put the full moon to shame, radiated over all her\nattendants, for she was like her of whom the poet said:\nShe was created flawless, as she wished,\nIn beauty’s mold, all charm and perfect grace,\nAs if her body was a liquid pearl,\nIn every part of which the moon to trace.\nEqualed by none she stood, the musk her scent,\nThe bough her figure, and the moon",

She adjured him to sit down, and he sat\nbelow her, while she began to demand what she wanted. When Ali ibn-\nBakkar saw her, he was beside himself with confusion, and his face flushed\nand turned pale, and as he tried to get up and go, in deference to her, healmost swooned. She gave him a flirtatious look with her narcissus eyes and\nwith a sweet smile said, “My lord, I come to you, and when I please you, you\nrun away from me.” He kissed the ground before her and replied, “When I\nsaw you, I lost my senses, for as the poet says:",

At the upper end of the room,\nnumerous lovely couches, covered with fabrics of various colors, stood, each\nbefore an arched window that opened on a garden. The garden looked as if it\nhad the same carpet for a floor cover. There the water flowed from a large\npond to a smaller one surrounded by sweet basil, lilies, and narcissus in pots\nof inlaid gold.

To the right and left of the pond stood couches of\nsandalwood covered with silver, and on each couch reclined a damsel more\ndazzling than the sun, wearing a gorgeous dress and holding a lute or some\nother musical instrument to her bosom. The damsels’ music blended with the\ncooing of the birds, and the wafting wind joined the rippling water, as the\nbreeze blew, lifting a rose here and downing a fruit there.

    " next: “Still looking at the young\nman, Shams al-Nahar forced herself to rise and, bidding the doors of the\nalcove be shut and the drapes be drawn upon us, she closed the doors of the\nhall behind her and went out into the garden. Then she bade the other couches\nbe removed, seated herself on her couch, and bade one of her damsels sit and\nrub her feet. Then she said to one of the maids, ‘Give them permission to\ncome in.’ The three chief eunuchs came in with twenty other eunuchs, all\ndressed in elegant and beautiful uniforms, girdled with golden belts and\ngirded with swords. They saluted in the best of manners, and Shams al-Nahar\nsaluted back and received them with respect and good cheer. Then turning to\nMasrur, she asked, ‘What is your wish?’ He replied, ‘The Commander of the\nFaithful salutes you and inquires after your health.

Then she said to the eunuchs,\n‘Go with God’s protection and care and tell the Commander of the Faithful\nwhat you have seen, so that he may wait a while until I arrange the furniture\nand make the place ready.’”\nThe eunuchs left hurriedly, and Shams al-Nahar rose and went to her\nbeloved and his friend, who",

She embraced Nur al-\nDin Ali, pressing him hard to her breast, and wept bitterly. He said to her, “O\nmy lady, this separation will lead to my destruction and death. May God\ngrant me patience until I see you again, and may He grant me another\nopportunity to be with you.” She replied, “You yourself will leave safely;\nyour passion will remain concealed, your love will be safeguarded, and no\none will know how you feel. I, however, will face doom and destruction, for\nthe caliph expects what he is used to from me, something in which I can no\nlonger satisfy him because of my great love for you and my grief at parting\nfrom you.

Suddenly, as they were looking, into the garden came more\nthan a hundred eunuchs who looked like bridegrooms dressed with colorful\ncostumes, girdled with gold belts, and girded with swords. With them came\nmore than one hundred pages, each bearing a camphor candle, and with them\ncame the Caliph Harun al-Rashid, swaying between Masrur and Wasif,\nintoxicated. He was followed by twenty girls as lovely as the sun, wearing the\nfinest clothes and adorned with jewels that glittered around their necks and\non their heads. They were met under the trees by Shams al-Nahar, followed\nby girls bearing musical instruments. When she kissed the ground before the\ncaliph, he said to her, “Welcome, my joy, my life’s bliss, and my heart’s\ndelight.” Then he leaned on her arm and walked with her until he reached the\nsilver couch, where he seated himself.

Abu al-Hasan related later: “I saw jewels the likes\nof which had never before graced my eyes or even my imagination, dazzling\nmy mind and making my heart beat with excitement, until I thought that I\nwas in a dream, while Ali ibn-Bakkar, feeling weak and dejected, layprostrate on the ground, loath to see what I saw and depressed to think what I\nthought.

May God the Deliverer deliver me from my predicament.’ I\nreplied, ‘There is no recourse but to be patient until the Almighty God sends\nyou relief.’ Then he turned to look at the scene again.\n“When everything was readied before the Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he\nturned to one of the damsels who had come with him and said, ‘Sweetheart,\nsing me a song.’ The damsel played the lute and sang the following verses:\nIf water can turn cheeks into green fields,\nMy tears might have covered my cheeks with green,\nReflecting",

Abu al-Hasan kept looking at her, and when he turned to\nher beloved, he found him unconscious, lying on his face motionless. He said\nto himself, “Fate has proved kind to them both, by treating them equally.”\nBut, aware of the grave danger, he was overwhelmed with alarm.

His friend the\ndruggist said to him, “Wake up at once or you will destroy us with you.”\nThen they carried him and went down with him from the gallery, and the girl,opening a small iron gate, brought them out to a jetty on the river. She\nclapped her hands softly, and a rowboat appeared with a boatman, who rowed\nuntil the boat touched the jetty. Abu al-Hasan related later, “As we entered\nthe boat, the young lover, stretching one hand toward the palace and the\nyoung lady’s apartment and placing the other on his heart, recited in a faint\nvoice the following verses:\nI stretched one feeble hand to bid adieu\nAnd place",

As soon as Ali ibn-\nBakkar went in, he collapsed on the bed, suffering from longing, grief, and\nexhaustion. The two men slept a while, and when Abu al-Hasan awoke, he\nordered the servants to spread the furnishings. He related later: “I said to\nmyself, ‘Let me entertain him and distract him, for I know very well the\ntorment he feels for leaving his beloved behind.’ Then I thanked God for my\ndeliverance from danger and pledged alms in gratitude.\n“When the young man awoke and sat up, I said to him, ‘Refresh\nyourself.’” Ali ibn-Bakkar called for water, and when the servants brought it,\nhe rose and, performing his ablutions, prayed the obligatory prayers, which\nhe had missed the past day and night.

When Abu al-Hasan saw this, he turned to\nhim and said, “My lord, it would be better for you in your condition to stay\nwith me tonight, so that you may make merry with me, enjoy the\nentertainment and diversion, and relieve yourself from the anguish of your\nlove and longing, and perhaps God will send you relief from your affliction.”\nAli ibn-Bakkar replied, “Do as you wish, for I will not contradict you.” Abu\nal-Hasan related later, “I summoned his servants, invited his friends, and\nbrought a singing woman.

But I am not satisfied with this explanation, and, knowing\nwhat close friends you two have been, tell me truly and in detail all you\nknow, for I have come to you to plead, investigate, and find out.’ When Ali\nibn-Bakkar heard what I said, his color changed, and, looking visibly shaken,\nhe replied, ‘I have never heard or had any inkling of his departure until you\ntold me. What you say, if it is true, makes me feel sobered, alarmed,\ndiscouraged, and worn-out.’ Then he sobbed and recited the following verses:\nI used to weep for errors of the past,\nWhile those I love were present with me still,\nBut now that fate has ",

I\nasked her, ‘What is the news?’ She replied, ‘I went to my lady and showed\nher the letter, and when she seemed upset and worried, I said to her that she\nshould not worry, fear, or grieve that Abu al-Hasan’s absence would harm\nher relationship with Ali ibn-Bakkar, adding that I had found another man to\ntake his place.

So get ready to go with me to her, with God’s blessing and\nhelp.’” When the jeweler heard the girl’s words, he saw that what she\nproposed was a grave matter, not to be undertaken lightly or entered into\nrashly, and he said to her, “You should know that I am not a man of high rank\nlike Abu al-Hasan, who used his wares for an excuse to ent",

But each\ntime he rose to go with her, his legs failed him and his hands trembled.\nFinally the girl said to him, “Never mind; she will come to you, but do not\nstir from your place.”She went away in a hurry; then she came back and said, “Beware that\nnone should be with you in the house, for he may tell.” The jeweler related\nlater: “I replied, ‘There is no one with me.’ Then with the utmost caution, she\nwent ou",

For two days, I lay quietly at\nhome and was unable to do much.\n“When I began to regain my strength, I went to the bath, still very much\nworried about the young man and the young lady. I did not dare to go near his\nhouse or visit any place, for fear of meeting him, for I had repented to God of\nmy former conduct, given alms in gratitude for my safety, and reconciled\nmyself to my loss.\n“Then I thought of going to a certain place to visit some friends and\ndivert myself, for my ordeal had taken a heavy toll on me. I went out,\nremonstrating with myself, until I came to the cloth market and sat there for a\nwhile with a friend of mine. When I rose to go, I saw a woman standing\nbefore me, and when I looked at her closely, I recognized Shams al-Nahar’s\nmaid.

She went in after me and, expressing sorrow for me, asked\nme about my condition. I told her all that had happened to myself and to Ali\nibn-Bakkar, then said, ‘Tell me what happened to you personally and what\nhappened to your lady after she left us.’\n“She replied, ‘As for myself, when I saw the men, fearing that they were\nthe caliph’s officers who came to seize me and my mistress forthwith and\ntake us to our ruin, I and the two maids fled over the rooftops from place to\nplace until we took refuge with some people who took pity on us and helped\nus reach our place early in the morning, in the sorriest of plights.

When the boat touched the jetty and the\nwoman landed, I was surprised to see that it was my lady, and I rejoiced in\nher safety.’”\nBut morning overtook Shahrazad, and she lapsed into silence. Then\nDinarzad said to her sister, “What a strange and entertaining story!”\nShahrazad replied, “What is this compared with what I shall tell you\ntomorrow night if the king spares me and lets me live!

Then he\ndeparted and I returned and locked the gate. Then I and two maidservants\ncarried Shams al-Nahar, who was almost dead from exhaustion, and laid her\non her bed. She slept the rest of that night and the following day, while Iforbade the maidservants from going in.\n“At last she awoke, as if she had risen from the dead, and I sprinkled her\nface with rosewater scented with musk, washed her hands and feet, and\nchanged her clothes.

I was sure that I was going to be killed, and I gave\nmyself up for lost. When the robbers took us from the jeweler’s house, they\nasked me who I was, and I said that I was a singing girl; then they asked my\nbeloved, and he replied that he was one of the common people. Then they\ntook us to their place, and it was nothing but fear that gave us the strength to\nwalk with them.\n“‘But when we were with them in their place and they looked at me and\nat my jewelry, they did not believe me and said that no singing girl could\nhave such jewelry and asked me to tell them the truth.

When he and I remained silent, they\nasked us to tell them who was the owner of the house. When we replied that\nhe was so and so, one of them said that he knew him and knew where he\nlived, adding that with luck he would bring him back immediately. Then they\nagreed to set me in one room by myself and my beloved in another room by\nhimself, and their chief asked us to rest there without fear until they found out\nwho we were, assuring us that our lives and possessions would be safe.\n“‘Then their comrade went out and brought that man (meaning you), and\nwhen he revealed to them who we were, they apologized and went out at\nonce and, bringing a boat, put us in it and rowed us to the other side.

Then I added that I had the\nwherewithal to reward him, and he dismounted and placed me on his horse\nand bade his men do the same with Ali ibn-Bakkar and the jeweler. At last I\narrived, as you saw, without knowing what happened to Ali ibn-Bakkar or thejeweler. My heart is on fire for them, especially for the jeweler, who had lost\nhis goods.

Then he began to eat and drink,\ngiving one banquet after another and dispensing gifts, favors, and honors\nuntil his steward came to him one day and said, “My lord Nur al-Din, have\nyou not heard the saying ‘He who spends without reckoning, becomes poor\nwithout knowing it’?

    "r al-Din, have\nyou not heard the saying ‘He who spends without reckoning, becomes poor\nwithout knowing it’? My lord, this enormous expense and lavish giving will\nerode even mountains.” When Nur al-Din heard his steward’s words, he\nlooked at him and said, “I will not listen to one word of yours. Haven’t you\nheard the poet say:\nIf I have wealth and be not liberal,\nMay my hand wither and my foot be stilled.\nShow me the niggard who has glory won;Show me the man who by giving was killed.”\nNur al-Din added, “It is my wish that if you have enough for my morning\nmeal, worry me not about my supper a great deal.” The steward said, “Is this\nwhat you wish?” Nur al-Din replied, “Yes.” Then the steward left him and\nwent away while he continued to pursue his pleasures and his lavish ways, so\nthat if someone chanced to say to him, “My lord Nur al-Din, such and such\nan orchard of yours is lovely,” he would reply, “It is yours as an irrevocable\ngift from a friend,” and if the man asked for the deed, he ",

In this way he lived an entire year, giving daily\nbanquets, one in the morning, a second in the evening, and a third at\nmidnight.\nOne day, as he sat listening to Anis al-Jalis sing these verses:\nYou thought well of the days when they were good,\nOblivious to the ills fate brings to one.\nYou were deluded by the peaceful nights,\nYet in the peace of night does sorrow stun,\nthere was knocking at the door.

When he opened the door, he\nfound the steward standing there, and when he asked him, “What is the\nmatter?” the steward replied, “My lord, what I feared has come to pass.” Nur\nal-Din asked, “How so?” The steward replied, “To put it briefly, you should\nknow that there is not even a dirham’s worth left of your possessions in my\nhands; here is the record of what was entrusted to your servant in my lord",
    "e steward replied, “To put it briefly, you should\nknow that there is not even a dirham’s worth left of your possessions in my\nhands; here is the record of what was entrusted to your servant in my lord’s\nown handwriting.” When Nur al-Din heard this, he bowed his head and said,\n“This is God’s wish, for there is no power, save in God.”\nAs soon as the man who had secretly followed Nur al-Din heard what\nthe steward said, he returned to his companions and said to them, “You\nshould consider what to do, for Nur al-Din is bankrupt and destitute.” They\nreplied, “We will not stay with him.” Meanwhile Nur al-Din dismissed the\nsteward and returned to them with a troubled look. Then one of them rose\nand, turning to him, said, “My lord, perhaps you will give me leave to\ndepart.” Nur al-Din asked, “For what reason?” The man replied, “My wife is\ndue to give birth today, and I cannot be absent from her and wish to be with\nher.” Nur al-Din gave him leave, and another rose, made an excuse, and\ndeparted.

Then each in turn gave excuse until all ten companions were gone\nand Nur al-Din was left alone.\nThen he called Anis al-Jalis, and when she came, he said to her, “O Anis\nal-Jalis, do you see what has happened to me?” and he related to her what the\nsteward had told him. She said, “My lord, your family and friends have\nwarned you, but you refused to listen. O my lord, some nights ago I intended\nto speak to you about the matter, but I heard you recite these verses:\nIf fortune befriend you be kind to all,\nBefore she slips away and lets you down.\nMunificence will not undo it if she smile,\nAnd avarice will not preserve it if she frown.\nWhen I heard you, I kept quiet and decided not to open the subject.” Nur al-\nDin said to her, “O Anis al-Jalis, you know that I have spent my money on\nnone save my ",

He went to the first door, and when\nhe knocked, a maid came out and asked, “Who are you?” He replied, “O girl,\nsay to your master, ‘My lord Nur al-Din Ali ibn-Khaqan stands at the door\nand wishes to kiss your hand and greet you.’” The girl went in and told her\nmaster, who yelled at her, saying, “Go out and say to him, ‘My master is not\nat home,’” and the girl came out and said to Nur al-Din, “My master is no",

She disappeared, then returned,\nsaying, “Sir, he ain’t here.” Nur al-Din smiled and said to himself, “Maybe I\nwill find another who will help me.” So he went to ",

Then he turned to Anis al-Jalis and asked, “What is left to sell\nnow?” She replied, “O my lord, it is my advice that you should rise at once\nand take me down to the market and sell me. You know that your father\nbought me for ten thousand dinars; perhaps the Exalted and Glorious God\nwill help you get close to this amount for me, and if it is His will to reunite\nus, we will meet again.” Nur al-Din replied, “O Anis al-Jalis, by God, I\ncannot endure to be parted from you one single hour.” She said, “By God, my\nlord, nor can I; but necessity compels, as the poet says:\nNecessity compels us to resort\nSometimes to ways that decent men oppose.\nNo man forces himself to do a thing,\nExcept what is dictated by the c",

The broker replied, “O my lord Nur al-Din,\nyour interest is protected,” adding, “Isn’t she Anis al-Jalis, whom your father\nbought some time ago for ten thousand dinars?” Nur al-Din replied, “Yes, she\nis.” Then the broker looked around and, seeing that many merchants werestill absent, waited until the market",

When she saw him in this condition, she said to him, “I conjure\nyou by God and by the god you worship, if I ask you a question, will you\nanswer me truthfully?” He, being unconscious and not knowing what he was\nsaying, replied, “Yes.” She said, “O my lord and my darling, when you\nlooked and did not find me, did you not search for me until you found me in\nthe garden in the form of a white she-bird and saw a black bird mount me,\nthen saw me turn back into my human form?” He replied, “Yes.” She said,\n“That black bird was one of my officers, whom I loved, but one day he cast\nhis eye on one of my women, and I became jealous and turned him into a bird\nand killed the woman.

In\nthe middle of the night, she rose from bed, while Badr lay awake, pretending\nto be asleep, and watched with one eye to see what she was doing. She took\nred sand from a bag and spread it on the floor of the room, and it became a\nrunning stream. Then she took out a handful of barley and strewed it in the\nsoil on the bank of the stream and watered it with the water from the stream,\nand it turned into ears of barley. Then she reaped the barley and ground it\ninto meal. Then she laid the meal aside and, returning to bed, slept beside\nKing Badr till the morning.\nWhen it was morning, King Badr rose and, as soon as he washed his\nface, asked her leave to visit the old man. She gave him leave and he went to\nthe old man and told him what he had seen.

Then leave her and come to me, and I will take care of\nyou.”\nThen King Badr bade the old man farewell and, returning to the palace,\nwent in to the queen. When she saw him, she said, “Welcome!” and she rose\nand kissed him, saying, “O my lord, you have tarried too long from me.” He\nreplied, “I have been with my uncle, who gave me some of this barley mealto eat.” She replied, “We have better than this.” Then she put his meal in one\ndish and hers in another and said to him, “Eat of this, for it is better than\ny",

Then\nKing Badr took water in his hand and threw it in her face, saying, “Leave this\nform and turn into a dappled she-mule,” and she became at once a dappled\nshe-mule. When she saw herself in this condition, the tears rolled down her\nface, and she began to rub her cheeks against his feet. He tried to bridle her,\nbut she would not let him; so he left her and went to the old man and told him\nwhat had happened, and the old man took out a bridle, saying, “Bridle her\nwith this, for, when she sees it, she will submit and let you bridle her.” King\nBadr took the bridle and returned to the queen, and when she saw him, she\ncame up to him, and he set the bit in her mouth, and, mounting h",

When the old man saw her, he said to\nher, “May God shame you, O cursed woman! Do you see what He has done\nto you?” Then he said to King Badr, “My son, it is time for you to leave this\ncity. Ride her and go wherever you like, but beware of relinquishing the\nbridle to anyone.” King Badr thanked him and bade him farewell.\nThen he rode on for three days until he came near a city, where he metan attractive gray-headed old man, who asked him, “Son, where are you\ncoming from?” King Badr replied, “From the City of the Magicians.” The old\nman replied, “You are my guest,” but while they were conversing, up came\nan old woman, who, when she looked at the she-mule, began to cry, saying,\n“This she-mule resembles my son’s she-mule, which is dead, and my ",

O young man, for God’s sake, sell her to me.” King Badr\nreplied, “Mother, by God, I cannot sell her.” She said, “For God’s sake, do\nnot refuse me, for my son will surely die if I do not buy him this she-mule,”\nand she pressed him until he said to her, “I will not sell her for less than a\nthousand dinars.” She said to him, “Say to me, ‘She is sold to you for a\nthousand dinars.’” King Badr, saying to himself, “Where could this old\nwoman get a thousand dinars? I will say that the she-mule is sold to her and\nsee where she will get the money,” replied, “She is sold to you.” When she\nheard his words, she took out from her pocket a thousand dinars, and when he\nsaw the money, he said to her, “Mother, I was joking with you, for I cannot\nsell her.” But the old man looked at him ",

Then\nDinarzad said to her sister, “O sister, what a strange and entertaining\nstory!” Shahrazad replied, “What is this compared with what I shall tell you\ntomorrow night if I stay alive!”\nT\nHE \nT\nWO \nH\nUNDRED AND \nS\nIXTY-\nN\nINTH \nN\nIGHT\nThe following night Shahrazad said:\nI heard, O happy King, that King Badr dismounted from the she-mule\nand delivered her to the old woman, who, as soon as she received her,\nremoved the bit from her mouth, took water in her hand, and sprinkled her\nwith it, saying, “O my daughter, leave this form and return to your human\nform.” The queen was at once restored to, her",

Then King Badr realized that the old\nwoman was Queen Lab’s mother and that he had been tricked, and he wantedto flee, but there was nowhere to go.\nThen the old woman gave a loud whistle, and there appeared before her\na demon, as huge as a mountain. She mounted on his back and placed her\ndaughter behind her, and the demon, putting King Badr on his shoulder, flew\noff with them and soon brought them to the palace of Queen Lab. When the\nqueen sat down on the throne, she looked at King Badr and said, “You\nworthless fellow, here I am; I have attained my wish and I will show you\nwhat I will do to you and to that wretched old fava-bean seller.

Then she put him in a cage and withheld from him\nall food and water.\nBut one of her women took pity on him and gave him food and water\nwithout the queen’s knowledge. Then she went to the old man and told him\nwhat had happened and informed him that the queen intended to destroy his\nnephew. He thought it over, pondering what to do with the queen, and finally\nsaid, “I must take this city from her.” Then he gave a loud whistle, and there\nappeared before him a demon with four wings, to whom he said, “O Barq,\ntake this girl, who has pitied King Badr and given him food and water, and\ncarry her to the city of Jullanar of the Sea a",

The girl descended from the roof and, going\nin to the queen, kissed the ground before her and told her what had happened\nto her son from beginning to end. Jullanar rose and kissed her face and\nthanked her. Then she ordered the drums to beat in the city in celebration and\ninformed her family that King Badr had been found.
